# Overview

This document aims to describe the ways in which the Open Voice Network (OVON)
will work with regards to knowledge sharing, meetings, etc.

## Meeting processes

* **Meetings will begin and conclude promptly at the scheduled times.**
  If it is deemed important by the committee chair and/or meeting moderator to
  continue a conversation beyond the scheduled adjournment time, the chair or
  moderator will pause the meeting at the scheduled adjournment time, and
  invite participants to continue.  No decision will be taken by a committee
  outside the scheduled meeting window. 
* **Meetings will operate under the Linux Foundation antitrust guidelines.**
  The Linux Foundation antitrust guidelines are available at URL
  <https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy/>.
  A statement to this effect, along with a slide that shows the URL of the
  Linux Foundation antitrust guidelines, will be shown at the beginning of
  every OVON standing and technical project committee meeting.
* **Meeting agendas will be published 48 hours in advance.**
  Meeting agendas will be distributed to meeting participants no less than 48
  hours in advance. Meeting agendas for the OVON Technical Committee will be
  posted in the OVON GitHub Docs Repo no than 48 hours in advance of the meeting.   
* **Meetings will foster accountability and follow-up.**
  The review of relevant and outstanding issues will be a stated agenda item
  early on the agenda of every OVON Technical Committee and Work Group meeting.
  The Technical Committee and Technical Committee Work Groups will use GitHub
  (see below) to document issues for resolution. Relevant and outstanding
  Github issues will be reviewed in every meeting.
* **Meetings will be recorded, and notes will be taken.**
  All scheduled meetings of the Technical Committee and Working Groups will be
  recorded, using the recording technology of the web conferencing platform in
  use. Full audio-visual meeting recordings will be stored in the Technical
  Committee OVON Google Share Drive. An announcement of “this meeting is being
  recorded” will be made at the beginning of every meeting. Notes will be taken
  of all Technical Committee meetings, published within 48 hours in the OVON
  GitHub docs file. 

## A sample meeting checklist

* At the **START** of the meeting:
  * [ ] Start the recording
  * [ ] Identify the meeting attendees who will take and publish meeting notes
  * [ ] Read the meeting invocation and antitrust guidelines
  * [ ] Give any new attendees an opportunity to introduce themselves
* **DURING** the meeting:
  * [ ] Follow the meeting agenda
  * [ ] Pay attention to the clock; end on time.
* At the **END** of the meeting:
  * [ ] Identify deliverables and responsible parties
* **AFTER** the meeting:
  * [ ] Publish meeting notes
  * [ ] Publish meeting recording 

## Working tools

The Technical Committee will use the following technologies:

* Github for technical document management and review, at <https://github.com/orgs/open-voice-network>.
* Slack for instant messaging and quick issue resolution. You will be added to the OVON Slack channels
  upon invitation to the OVON Technical Committee, a project task force, or one of the OVON Communities.
  To request participation in the OVON Slack Channels, please e-mail the OVON Executive Director
  (<jon.stine@openvoicenetwork.org>). 
* Google G Suite (as noted above) for non-technical document management (calendars, some non-TC meeting
  notes, meeting recordings, relevant financial documents, etc.). Technically-focused committees and
  project task forces will use GitHub for document management; other OVON Communities and committees
  (such as Ethical Use and Education) will use Google G Suite for document storage and management.
  To obtain access, please request access via an e-mail to the OVON Executive Director
  (<jon.stine@openvoicenetwork.org>), and include your e-mail address (required for access to G Suite).

## OVON Technical Committee Work Groups 

Working groups are the teams that execute work against the activities.  When a working group exists,
they accountable for issue documentation, backlog management, and document development into the OVON
GitHub repository.  Working Groups will also form and define their own leads/leadership. 

Technical Committee Work Groups formed:  

* **Architecture Work Group**  
  * formed in 6/26/20 Technical Committee meeting 
* **Privacy & Security Work Group** 
  * formed in 6/26/20 Technical Committee meeting 
* **Voice Registry System (VRS) Work Group**
  
## Work Group Decision-Making

Open Voice Network Technical Committee Work Groups are formed by the Technical Committee to research
and recommend a solution or way forward on a topic determined to be of importance to the OVON mission.
Recommendations are to be brought back to the Technical Committee, which may forward the recommendation
to the OVON Steering Committee for endorsement and/or the allocation of resources.

Work Groups are:

* Moderated by one or more regular participants in the Work Group
* expected to conduct business in a manner that is open, professional, and in keeping with the OVON
  Communities Code of Conduct found at <www.openvoicenetwork.org>
* expected to seek a diversity of views, and to welcome minority viewpoints and robust discussion
* asked to seek consensus decisions (and if a consensus cannot be reached, to achieve a decision by at least a two-thirds majority)
* expected to begin and close meetings with a review of outstanding and new issues, respectively

## Open Voice Network Technical Documentation

The [OVON documentation repository](https://github.com/open-voice-network/docs) contains published and
work in progress artifacts, docs, schemas, technical committee working group meeting minutes, etc of the OVON. 
The documentation repository is organized by working group, with a separate folder for the technical committee.

## Do you want to contribute?

Depending on your comfort and permission, there are multiple ways you may find yourself contributing via:

* **Fork + PR** -- this approach is only needed if you don't have write access directly to the repo.
  See this for help: <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>
* **Branch + PR** - this approach is used if you already have write access to the repo.
  See this for help: <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>

New to Git and not comfortable doing things in the command line? If you prefer to work with a GUI, GitHub
does allow either approach above all within the UI.

Whatever steps you followed above, you will end in a Pull Request, also known as PR. This is required for
all changes to this repo. Do not commit directly to the `master` branch.

In the PR process, you will not see your changes right away. It is an area of discussion where the reviewer
can ask for more questions or clarification about the changes you made. It is **best practice**, but not
required to add/refer-to the issue number in the PR comments so it is easier to understand the context
and background for why the PR is being made. 

## Intellectual Property Policy

The [OVON Intellectual Property Policy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link OVON-Intellectual-Property-Policy.md %})
describes the licensing requirements for any contributed or published material. The Linux Foundation provides
information on how to comply with the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) at <https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/dco>.
