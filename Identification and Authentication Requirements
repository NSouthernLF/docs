### 1.0 Purpose

The Open Voice Network proclaims as its motto, “voice technology worthy of user trust”. The purpose of this document is to describe a set of attributes that conversational assistants may exhibit to allow for their identification and authentication in support of that trustworthiness. These requirements are presented independently from any technology or human processes that may be developed as implementations. Indeed, it is possible that some of these requirements will prove to be unfeasible at this time but realizable at some future point. Note that this document only pertains to identification and authentication of conversational assistants, and not to analogous mechanisms for identification and authentication of human users.

### 1.1 Definitions

● 	**Authentication**: the process of verifying an asserted identification (qv); in this context, the ability to demonstrate that a conversational assistant is verifiably who it claims to be.

● 	**Conversation**: a joint activity in which two or more participants (human or automated) use linguistic forms and non-verbal signals (i.e., gestures) to communicate to achieve an outcome that meets a shared goal.

● 	**Conversational assistant**: a digital participant in a conversation (qv); a piece of technology (hardware/software) that accepts natural language requests expressed using one or more of text, voice, and graphics from the user, processes the requests, and presents results to the user using one or more of  text, voice, and/or graphics..

● 	**Identification**: a set of attributes that serve to uniquely and unambiguously distinguish one entity (here, a conversational assistant) from all others.

●	**TrustMark**: an initiative of the Open Voice Network to promote the principles and core values of trustworthy conversational AI.

●	**Trustworthiness**: a subjective human judgment based on available attributes that a conversational assistant will correctly perform the task it was designed for and will not engender undesirable side effects.
