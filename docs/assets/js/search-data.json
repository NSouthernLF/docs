    "content": "The Open Voice Network is a non-profit industry association, operating as a Directed Fund of The Linux Foundation, and dedicated to the development of technical standards and ethical use guidelines. This is an essential step for a technology and an industry that is in its earliest days, and for which user and developer value falls far short of envisioned potential. The Open Voice Network (OVN) Architecture Plan is a directional document with high-level design details that lays out the set of open standards in effort to define discrete components and interfaces that comprise a voice assistent, channels of communication, and discovery of voice applications. We believe that by defining the building blocks of this overaching voice application architecture, we can define interfaces that allow those building blocks to be reusable thereby fostering a voice application development community that can create, publish, and utilize components. Our goal is to foster a voice application and voice channel eco-system rich with reusable components. The content of this document defines the scope of what the OVN aims to work on and the sections below can map to working groups who will be defining components and component interfaces. ",

    "title": "Suzanne Case Study",
    "content": "A user, Suzanne, would like to plan a trip to an international conference and she needs visa information and airline reservations. This is a futuristic scenario in which Suzanne has a personal agent named Jeeves inspired by the in BBC TV series Jeeves and Wooster based on a series of books by P. G. Wodehouse. For the next few years when Jeeves is not available, Suzanne would need to do all the tasks perform by Jeeves. This scenario features issues of privacy, security, and component behavior. | Suzanne begins by pressing a button on her cell phone to begin her conversation with her Jeeves. Jeeves is local to Susan’s phone and has permission to access Susan’s personal data. | Jeeves: Hi, I’m Jeeves, your personal assistant. Could you please say your name? Jeeves will use three forms of user authentication based on Susan’s personal data. Suzanne can change this if she wants. | Suzanne: I’m Suzanne | Jeeves invokes speaker authentication component to verify that it really is Suzanne. | Jeeves also uses the camera on the cell phone to do a face recognition of Suzanne. | Jeeves: I think you might be Suzanne, but to be sure, please apply your secret calculation to the number 13 | Suzanne applies her secret calculation, subtract 3, and responds by saying 3. This is also a type of challenge dialog that uses something the user knows to verify who the user is. It also verifies that the user is not a robot. Note that a password is not used because I hate passwords  | Jeeves: Hi Suzanne, how can I help you? | Suzanne: I will be speaking at the EuroSpeech Conference in Paris, and I need want to check about visa information Jeeves uses the dialog broker to discover the visa agent. | Jeeves: I can connect you with a visa agent. Do you want me to share your personal information with the Visa agent? Before the visa agent can access Suzanne’s personal data, Susan must grant permission. | Suzanne: OK Jeeves passes Susann’s request to the visa agent. | Jeeves: Hello Suzanne, I’m the visa agent. I understand that you are traveling to Paris to the EuroSpeech conference. I see that you have a US passport that expires on February 12, 2021. The visa agent checks EuroSpeech web page to determine the dates of the conference. | Visa agent: The EuroSpeech conference is February 20-23, 2021. Your passport will expire before then. Would you like help to renew your passport? | Suzanne: yes | Jeeves: the cost of a renewed passport will be $150 plus my service fee of $25 for a total cost to you of $175. Is that OK? Jeeves always checks with Suzanne about estimated costs of services | Jeeves looks at the computing devices available to Suzanne and located a large display screen. In the past, Suzanne has used the large screen to display large chunks of data rather than the screen on her cell phone. Jeeves displays the passport renew form on the large screen and enters information from Susan’s personal data into the form. | Jeeves: a passport renewal form is on the large screen in your office. I have inserted your personal information into that form. Except for question 14, are the answers to the questions correct? Question 14 requests the names of countries Suzanne plans to visit. This info is not in Suzanne’s personal data. | Suzanne: yes | Jeeves: Thanks, Please speak the answer to question 14 into the microphone or type the answer on your cell phone keyboard | Suzanne: I only plan to visit France in the next year | Jeeves places the answer France into question 14 | Jeeves: Good. Now I need to take your picture and scan your current passport or valid driver license. | Jeeves instructs Suzanne to look straight at the camera, adjusts the focus of the camera, zooms the camera appropriately, then takes Suzanne’s picture. | Jeeves: your picture is displayed on your phone screen. Does it look OK | Suzanne: yes | Jeeves: Excellent, next we need scan your passport or driver’s license. Please open your passport to the page with your picture and place it on the scanner in your office | Suzanne places her passport on the scanner. Scanner captures the image passport holder information | Visa agent exams the scanned data to verify that it is legible | Jeeves: Do you want to use your default charge card or PayPal to pay $150.00 to the US Department of State? | Suzanne: my default charge card | Jeeves: Do you want to use your charge card ending in 4443 to pay of $150.00 plus service fee of $25 for a total of $275? | Suzanne: yes | Jeeves: Done. I have sent a receipt to your e-mail address. | Jeeves: Can I now help you with airline reservations? | Suzanne: I’d like to arrive the day before the conference begins, and return two days after the end of the conference | Jeeves: so you would like fly from your hometown of Portland Oregon to arrive in Parris France n February 19, 2021 and return from Paris France to Portland Oregon on February 25, 2021? Jeeves uses information from Suzanne’s airline flight history to determine the departure airport. | Suzanne: yes. Jeeves uses the dialog broker to locate the airlines wizard. | Jeeves: I will connect you with Fred the flight scheduler who will assist you with this reservation. If you need me, just call my name, Jeeves invokes the airlines wizard. | Fred the flight scheduler: Hi, this is Fred the flight scheduler. Jeeves tells me that you are looking for flight from Portland Oregon to arrive in Parris France n February 19, 2021 and return from Paris France to Portland Oregon on February 25, 2021. I will display available flights from Portland Oregon on the large screen in your office. Do you see a flight you would like to book? | Susanne: yes, this one (and clicks her desired flight) | Fred: Jeeves tells me that you prefer an aisle seat, is that correct? | Susanne: yes | Fred: I have reserved seat 22B. I will display available flights from Paris France on the large screen. Do you see a flight you would like to book? | Suzanne: yes, that one (and clicks her desired flight) | Fred: I’ve reserved that flight as well as isle seat 23B. Would you like to purchase the flights now? | Suzanne: No, I want to purchase the flights directly from the airlines. | Jeeves: Do you want me to connect you to fly-by-night airlines so you can book your flight to Paris? | Suzanne, no I’ll do that later. Make a note to remind me about this tomorrow. | Jeeves: Noted | Suzanne pauses to drink a cup of coffee. During this pause, she hears an advertisement | Sound Cloud agent: This is Sound Cloud. Here is a new posting from your favorite jazz band, two five, one A preview of music is presented. | Sound cloud agent: Would you like to download it for a price of 8 membership points? | Suzanne: Yes, I like it. | . Once the user has found out about the visa, she tells the PA that she wants to make airline reservations. She specifies her dates of travel and airline preferences and the PA then interacts with her to find appropriate flights. A similar process will be repeated if the user wants to book a hotel, find a rental car, or find out about local attractions in the destination city. Booking a hotel as part of attending a conference could also involve finding out about a designated conference hotel or special conference rates. ",

Also would like to interface with airport parking to expedite parking | User receives an at-home diagnostic test. The test provider has a voice app for Alexa and Google Assistant to help them complete the test. The user activates the voice app and needs to authenticate in order to complete the test. Once the user is authenticated they use the voice app to complete the test and are prompted to complete follow up survey. The survey becomes anonymized and is then sent back to the provider for review. (Hopefully this was a good scenario) | In the store and need to find Gluten Free Pizza.

Meeting commenced at 9:02 a.m. Central Daylight Time (US). Welcome, antitrust statement, and notification of recording . Introductions: No new attendees . Announcements: . • J. Larson unable to attend today. • European Data Protection Board (EDPB) released “1.0 Guidelines for Virtual Voice Assistants.” General observations: applies GDPR to virtual voice assistance; is now the benchmark for the voice industry; current OVN privacy ork aligns nicely with the EDPB guidelines. o Other observations: EDPB guidelines focus on current state of the major platform duopology; does not anticipate the hybrid ecosystem of the independent enterprise virtual assistant; does not address a non-cloud architecture; does not address the future of interoperability – the sharing of dialogues; does not address issues related to voice data analysis, including biomarkers or other advanced voice data analysis. Work Group Progress Toward Quarterly Milestones . J. Stine reminded Work Groups in re: Q1 Deliverables (two weeks remaining) and Q2 Deliverables, to be defined by March 31, 2021. Also: an expectation that existing and in-work documents will be reconciled to the official OVN vocabulary by end of April 30, 2021 . Q1 Milestone Deliverables / Updates . VRS • Green – publish schema 1.0 • Green – agile practices • Green – job descriptions Two independent development companies have raised their hands to help build out the VRS MVP. Architecture • Blue – Deliver extensible foolproof strategy for sharing components by EOQ1. Architecture Work Group reported a pivot in strategy; from a standardization of components to research/study into what is required to share dialogues (and context, control, and privacy-security) between conversational agents. A five-step process documented, described for moving forward. Privacy &amp; Security Privacy • EDPB: review underway by the team. • Privacy Guidelines 1.0 – publishing the pull request to address items discussed in the Technical Committee “deep dive”. Will be incorporated this weekend. o Add legal disclaimer to document o More language for “opt in” by default o Mike will take first pass at the vocabulary also with this pull request • “Friends and families” – NRF, FMI, Ecommerce Europe, AVIOS conference, OVN Ethical Use are suggested candidates to review the document. Security • Threat Modelling exercise should be wrapped by end of April. • Doug: Threat Modelling output should be leveraged by the development teams of the VRS MVP implementation work. Maria: work slated for July. • Incorporate the scenarios from the Architecture group as the next round of threat modelling exercise. Privacy Policies Comparison, Analysis • Green: Q1 work on track. • Research work completed by end of March. • Plan to have the summary for Tuesday’s Privacy &amp; Security workgroup meeting. • Will be prepared to give a high-level overview of the summary in the next Technical Committee meeting. VRS Deep Dive • M. Brinas-Dobrowski provided a detailed overview of VRS process and decisions to date. Discussed at length the options and decision-making in re: the role of NLU in VRS identification and routing; noted clear preference to pursue simplicity – VRS to have a singular function. Also reviewed initial data schema for VRS registration/recognition. S. Prayaga noted need to determine, document registration processes; agreement that such work was still TBD. D. Rogers povided this guidance on semantic versioning: https://semver.org/ J. Stine noted interest from China Netcasting Services Association (CNSA) to engage, potentially adopt a VRS system from OVN. News/Notes: . • D. Cundiff noted formation of Croqui, start-up of former Mozilla team. May offer opportunities for OVN development work. Meeting adjourned at 9:58 CDT. ",

Comment/review: Adam Cheyer presentation of 2021.03.04 . | Good discovery algorithm will be complicated to define and put in place | Model interoperability is the focus of Adam’s work and was thought provoking | Loose coupling is a correlation with the OVN work so far | Key philosophical decision –really strong framework needed and we will need to be clear on the problems that we are trying to solve | Adam finds out work valuable but he feels we should be going beyond standards | Would love to learn more about Adam’s learnings and gain better understanding of his POV | Loved how he thinks and is true to his role | We need to assess if the big players are ready for standards | Voice assistance lack the back button like on the browser –no consistent approach for this with voice and might be an opportunity for OVN | .

Envision that the voice assistant could actually read the policy or point to a website for full policy detail. Some concern that this goal may not be achievable | The consumer has been in a position where the onus of data protection falls with them. Time is now for producers of technology to share that responsibility (meaning that implicit consent goes away) | . | Consent . | Is the present status of consent implicit today with current voice providers? Currently is implied and we are pushing for explicit | What is the process of the user disagrees with the consent? | How do we qualify this with respect to the law? | Guidelines need more teeth in order to be enforced.

Fricke, C. Wuttke, I. Mez, J. Eisenzopf, P. Bentsen . The meeting commenced at 09:03 Central Standard time (US). Antitrust statement and notice of recording – J. Stine . Review of the agenda – D. Cundiff . Ways of Working and Steps Forward – J. Stine . J. Stine presented and spoke to an overview of the next steps that Work Groups may take. Three key take-ways: 1) Work Groups will be asked to meet at least one more time to determine next steps. 2) Next steps could include a proposal to the Tech Comm (and then, potentially, the Steering Committee), or additional development work. 3) The determining question of the Technical Committee (and the Steering Committee) will be this: is this worthy of (and ready for) investment of time/personnel/monies en route to standardization? . Report from the Architecture Work Group: – J. Larson . J. Larson presented a summation of the work to date of the Architecture Work Group. | An important market transition is driving the need for this review: current and anticipated growth of independent voice assistance. | Problems to be resolved: development complexity, inconsistent terminology, reusability of components, extensibility, and interoperability of assistants. | Ecosystem and business benefits of resolution: speed, accelerate the creation of new and innovative speech applications; enable enterprises to build once and use many; create a standards-based foundation for commercial innovation, differentiation. | Architecture Work Group remit: identify, define, and prioritize common voice assistant components for potential standardization. | A 1.0 definition of a reusable component was presented: defined by input and output, defined as a collection of related functionalities, defined as flexible, and able to be used in many configurations, defined as a building block for applications-assistant creation. | A generic template of a reusable component was shown. | In reaching this point, the Architecture Work Group (AWG) had reviewed a sampling of assistant architectures, and components within. Those reviewed included that shown in the OVN Master Plan, and from the W3C Voice Interaction Community, David Attwater and Jonathan Eisenzopf, and from Dr. Monica Lam of the Stanford OVAL project. The AWG had also discussed potential new components (per Voice Registry System conversations). | The Architecture Work Group presented its 1.0 roadmap for component assessment and standardization. For a detailed review, please see https://github.com/open-voice-network/docs/blob/master/Architecture%20Work%20Group%20Working%20Draft%202020.11.18.md. | The AWG proposed two new components: A “voice agent finder” for an anticipated Voice Registry System, and for purposes of user-managed rivacy and consent, an Access-Consent Control Guard, as inspired by the Stanford OVAL Almond architecture. | The AWG noted four major outstanding questions: 1) the component(s) that should resolve VRS-centric search; 2) how components may be made (or defined in a way to be) future proof; 3) how to proceed forward with minimal viable components (such as ASR, NLU, TTS, Dialog Manager); and 4) the choice of the next component to refine. | Going forward, the AWG suggested five next steps: 1) establishment of a 1.0 definition criteria, with an emphasis upon future-proofing; 2) integration of AWG work with that of the Privacy and Security and VRS Work Groups; 3) selection of first components for detailed definition; 4) initiation of outside review, and development of artefacts worthy of a RFC; 5) initiation of Q1 2021 planning for prototype-MVP testing. | . Report from the VRS Work Group – M.Brinas-Dobrowski . | Goal – To make a decision if there is a market need/opportunity for a global platform voice registry | Terminologies | Problem . | Setup Mode | Runtime Mode | No consistent experience | Lack of standards | No interoperability | No consistency or transparency on disambiguation | . | Recommendations . | Advocate to stand up a neutral and single decentralized registry for voice application –the Voice Registry System | . | Architecture . | Arch guiding principles . | Single repository | Loose coupling | Event driven | Availability and partitioning eventual consistency | Interface segregation | Automation (CICD, etc.) | . | . | Roles &amp; Responsibilities . | Be neutral and single decentralized registry for voice application | Create voice application standards to provide a consistent experience | VRS is NOT responsible for the interpreting of the intent of the user | VRS can hold various attributes regarding the voice applications, such as name, alternative names, category, geolocation | VRS can receive inputs like the channels current location but is NOT responsible for storing its preference | VRS names can have synergies | . | Summation: . | Please review and add comments in git | Next Steps: Each work group decide how this impacts their work | . | Discussion: . | Disambiguation is at domain level | The Disambiguation problem will need to be broken down into multiple sub-problems | If VRS not responsible for interpreting intent, how will it get to the destination? -Additional discussions in the Architecture Group | Should we add the support of different languages? This will be folded into the requirements | VRS should be considered an Explicit request registry | Where does disambiguation occur? The conversation platform owns that with aid from VRS | . | Link to VRS Presentation | Link to VRS git doc | . Meeting adjourned at 10:27 CT . ",

Report, update from the Privacy &amp; Security Work Group of the Technical Committee – Mike Frazzini . | M. Frazzini provided update on the work, decisions to date of the Privacy and Security Work Group. Noted the Work Group’s decision to focus first on privacy, adopt a five-level framework (passive listening -&gt; wake word/invocation -&gt; application -&gt; personalization -&gt; emotion/sentiment, and to focus on four operational facets of privacy: data ownership, data use, transparency, and consent. | M. Frazzini presented examples of the work to date (content compiled on a common slide deck in the Google Share Drive), noted further work to be done. | Discussion: request from M. Brinas-Dobrowski for the Work Group to ensure language/nomenclature be aligned with that in the Master Plan; question-discussion regarding the anticipated recommendations from the OVN – might some of these recommendations be mandatory? Might some be mere recommendations? J.

Proposal, review of initial concepts: Voice Registry System (VRS) – Jim Larson, Maria Brinas-Dobrowski . | J. Larson spoke to the recent discussions within the OVN Developer Community regarding the value of, and potential capabilities of, a Voice Registry System – referred to as a “DNS for Voice” in prior OVN conversations. J. Larson proposed on behalf of the Developer Community that a VRS Work Group be formed, and tasked with initiating the process of defining the current problem and the capabilities of an aspirational future state. | M. Brinas-Dobrowski shared an initial overview of the VRS problem statement and potential solution archtecture, now available for review in the OVN docs repository on GitHub. | Discussion of the overview and steps to move a VRS Work Group forward. Recommended actions: 1) Work Group (and Technical Committee member) documentation of a) the problems to solve, and b) scenarios-stories that describe the use (and value) of a VRS. This to be brought to a new VRS Slack channel. 2) the reading and review of the M. Brinas-Dobrowski VRS overview now in the Masterplan, and found here: https://github.com/open-voice-network/docs/blob/master/components/voice_registry_system.md. 3) The recruitment of members and leadership for the VRS Work Group, and the scheduling of the first VRS Work Group meeting. | . Report, Update from the Architecture Work Group of the Technical Committee – John Iwasz and Jim Larson. | J. Larson, J. Iwasz reviewed for the Committee their proposal for a “component” approach to the question of an OVN reference architecture. Noted the value of a “Lego block” concept. Proposed to the group an operative definition of “components” and “harnesses” – the latter a collection of existing components that can be used to 1) demonstrate new components, 2) test and evaluate new components, and 3) prototype new voice applications. J. Iwasz noted that the Work Group will be reviewing proposed architectures from D. Attwater and J. Eisenzopf (next meeting), the W3C Voice Interaction Community (D. Schnelle-Walka and D.

Review of Milestones and work plans . | Draft document that can be used to guide our planning and milestones | Reflects how we move from workgroups to development and potentially to official projects under The Linux Foundation | 3 main streams –Foundational (ex. architecture and privacy), Process/Systems (ex. VRS), User Experience (ex. common commands) | Discussion . | We should put some definition around each of the 3 main streams | . | This document will be on the G-suite in the Tech Comm folder | . Report from the Privacy-Security Work Group: decisions and next steps - M. Frazzini . | The team met last Tuesday and is meeting weekly working towards deliverable goal of early August | Have prioritized privacy ahead of security and their goal to provide awareness and guidance with respect to the unique issues related to voice | Developing a matrix framework –of 6 levels tied to the life cycle of a voice transaction . | Passive listening | Basic - wake word invocation | Personalization | Application or invoking a 3rd party | Within the application –selection, authentication, transaction, payment | Emotion and Sentiment | . | Discussion . | NLP big players (AMZ, apple) –will this cover what they will keep or what would that look like? | We should align on terminology around things like 3rd party, commercial, etc. so it flows through technical master plan to each workgroup ACTION Privacy and Security group will take first pass at definitions and bring back | Need to understand AI data needs | What is the unintended consequence or harm –need to understand what we are trying to avoid (Harms Framework) | Knowing that the broader adoption may not happen, we will need to be practical and balance truly required work and the absolute north star | . | . Report from the Architecture Work Group: decisions and next steps - J. Iwasz . | Intent is to define a discreet set of components that define a working assistant (ex. NLP, TTS/STT) and how they interact with each other | By mid-September, will be bringing in speakers from W3C and Almond to leverage their work as much as possible | . Update from Architecture Work Group: a review of this past Tuesday’s discussion - D. Cundiff, D. Attwater, J. Eisenzopf, J. Larson, et. al. | The group met but was smaller and reviewed the Master Plan in detail | Major updates from the meeting: . | Principle: Can be applied as low as local host, a private network or as big as globally provided | Discussed integrations and standards for those integrations –and they can follow the principles outlined in the document | Discussed the Component Flow diagram . | the channel receives the utterance and responds back | TTS/STT –translates utterance to text | NLP – identifies the query’s VRS lookup entity and pass it to VRS | VRS – resolves the VRS lookup entity. It returns the configuration records NLP | Dialog Broker – returns the fulfillable intents | Dialog Manager – returns the proper response to the identified intents | . | Discussion today: . | would be helpful if there were a list of general principles being followed | we will not live in a voice only world so need to think about having both physical and verbal ACTION Dan will open up issues for these so the Arch Working group can complete | Jim Larson feels that the group should meet again to review in more detail. Others requested time from Dan Cundiff to review in more detail as well | We need identify the use cases that we need to solve and ground the vision in the use cases (the Designer and Strategist community is focusing on use cases by vertical) | The fulfillment logic may need to be explored more deeply and expanded to another level and be added to the document | how does this architecture support multiple devices (speakers, microphones)? | This work requires a coalition of many people with many agendas so important to be grounded in what can and cannot be done. So the path forward needs to be practical | Privacy concerns – keeping customer data accessible only to parties that need it ( and should not flow through a commercial channel provider). This brings a concern that the NLP processing may be found as a privacy exposure point. We will need to think about how to guarantee that only the responsible parties get the data | Did we distinguish between Voice Registry and Voice Name System –We’ve landed on Voice Registry System and will encompass both the registry and naming system | Use case suggestions: Airline reservation use case (Jim Larson), automobile voice use case (Shyamala ) and healthcare scenario (Peter B) ACTION Jim Larson, Shyamala and Peter B will write the uses cases in the next 2 weeks following the W3C example | . | . | Link to the The Master Plan document | . Update: Designer-Strategist Community – enterprise use cases - J. Stine . | was discussed within the above agenda items | . Request: review of the proposed “North Star” aspirational statement, now on GitHub: – J. Stine . | Jon reviewed the draft North Star document that outlines OVN goals and how we will accomplish and is meant for technical and non-technical audiences. 5 minute read to share out information on OVN in a quick, high-level and effective way | ask for members to review and provide feedback | Link to North Star document | . Feedback on todays meeting: . | good discussion | . ",

    "content": "Attendees: D. Cundiff (Chair, J. Larson, N. Myers, J-C. Junqua, C. Wuttke, N. Latwis, L. Lin, A. Dalloul, D. Attwater, M. Brinas-Dobrowski, M. Frazzini, P. Bentsen, V. Tai, S. Baul, M. Saul, J. Stine. Sending regrets: J. Maas, S. Prayaga. The meeting was brought to order at 9:01 CDT (US). Antitrust statement and notice of recording – J. Stine . Update on Ethical Use Community – J. Stine . J. Stine described the purpose of OVN Communities. Communities are advisory bodies comprised of voice practitioners and enthusiasts, responsible for advising Committees (especially the Technical Committee) on topics of interest. Decision-making rests with Committees, not Communities. The Ethical Use Community is now forming, and is developing a list of topics for study; high on that list is the topic of privacy. It is expected that contributions from the Ethical Use Community discussions on privacy will be brought forward to Privacy-Security Work Group of the Technical Committee. Request for Team Assistance in addressing question from major technology provider – J. Stine . J. Stine reported potential sponsorship discussions with a major technology provider, and the questions raised by that provider on topics of invocation and dependable discoverability. Discussion in re: potential OVN positions. J. Stine requested brief call in week of 2020.07.13 to sketch options; options to be reviewed by Tech Comm in 2020.07.24 meeting. Report from Architecture Work Group Meeting of 2020.07.07 – J. Larson . J. Larson reported activities and results from the first Technical Committee Architecture Working Group meeting of 2020.07.07. Working Group reviewed proposed architectures from OVN Master Plan (Cundiff/Brinas-Dobrowski) and the W3C Interactive Voice Community Group (Schnelle-Walka/Dahl). Discussions of decision methodology, distillation-definition of components and interfaces. Conversations to continue in next meeting (2020.07.21), and expand to include a review of the Almond architecture of the Stanford Open Voice Assistant Lab (OVAL) of Dr. Monica Lam. John Iwasz unanimously selected to serve as Work Group Moderator. Report from Privacy-Security Work Group Meeting of 2020.07.07 – M. Frazzini . M. Frazzini reported activities and results from the first Technical Committee Privacy-Security Work Group. Acknowledgement that the issues are intertwined, but that parsing will be needed to identify issues, potential areas for standards development. Initial problem statement drafted. Work Group Moderator not yet named. Review of the OVN Technical MasterPlan – M. Brinas-Dobrowski . It was agreed through discussion that although it would be useful to provide a “primer” overview of the Technical MasterPlan in the meeting, a 90-to-120-minute deep dive would be required and should be scheduled as a primary agenda item for the Technical Community. To that end, M. Brinas-Dobrowski provided a section-by-section overview of the MasterPlan in its current state, highlighting key points along the way. Significant discussion in re: concepts and potential complexity of a DNS, and approaches to architecture. A. Dalloul noted several options for the management of multiple end points; spoke to the challenges of an assumed “multi-home” environment, citing numerous examples (browers, mobile platforms) and extensive Microsoft research. A. Dalloul, D. Attwater, J-C Junqua spoke to the importance of use cases against which concepts can be tested. D. Attwater suggested that the architecture discussion may wish to step backwards, and consider data models and within that, the different entities (devices, enterprises, products, persons) to which a user may wish to connect. Question: what is a Dispatch Registry to do? Connect to some or all entities? . Next-steps summation – J. Stine . Four major next steps are planned: . | The Privacy-Security Work Group will meet again on Tuesday, 2020.07.14 | A “tech Provider Question” Work Group will be convened by J. Stine in the week of 2020.07.13, and report its recommendations back to the Technical Committee. | The Architecture Work Group will meet next on Tuesday, 2020.07.21. | A Technical Committee session will be devoted to the Master Plan. | . Recommendations for Next Meeting Agenda (2020.07.24). | Report from the Privacy-Security Work Group: decisions and next steps – M. Frazzini | Report from the Architecture Work Group: decisions and next steps – J. Iwasz. | Recommended enterprise use cases as suggested by the OVN Designer-Strategist Community – | Report from the “tech provider Question” Work Group: decisions and next steps – J. Stine. | Review of the proposed “North Star” aspirational statement: – J. Stine | . Meeting adjourned at 10:17 a.m. CDT. ",

Eisenzopf, D.Attwater . The meeting was brought to order at 8:31 CDT (US). Antitrust statement and notice of recording – Jon Stine . Github training and on-boarding meeting recordings – Jon Stine . | Per request in prior meeting, Jon conducted sessions on Github and onboarding. Recordings are available on OVN G-Suite for your review. | . Review Technical Committee and Developer Community inputs into proposed Activities list: Foundational –exploratory, etc. – Dan . There are 16 PRs and we will need to determine a workflow to review the PRs. Options: . | The PR creator assigns the PR review to someone (and they’ll get a notification) | rfr (request for review) –can post this in the Technical-committee slack channel along with your PR to create awareness of your PR ACTION: Align on PR review process | . Determination of Initial Prioritized Activities – Dan . | Activities are the work that needs to be done | The full list of voting results were posted by Jim Larson in the developer-experience slack channel (posted 6/22) | Initial Inputs to Priorities: . | Approaches for Voice Registry | Privacy and Data Protection | . | . Jim Larson feels that we all should better understand the architecture before proceeding much further . ACTION: Form a small working group to review and adjust the architecture ahead of a broader share out. S. Baul, M. Lens-FitzGerald, J.Iwasz, P.Bentsen, J.Larson, S.Prayaga and D.Cundiff will participate. This will be called the Architecture Working Group. ACTION: Conduct a session to go over the Master Plan &amp; Architecture after the Architecture Working group reviews &amp; edits. | Discussed items that didn’t get a lot of votes—this does not mean that these won’t be done, they are a lower priority and will go into an activities backlog | Discussed if we should place timelines on some of the activities. The working groups likely need to get formed to define milestones | Discussed if we should we create a starting milestone framework to aid in timing. ACTION Jon and Dan to create draft milestone framework | . Determination of Activities work team participants &amp; leaders – Dan &amp; Jon . | Working groups are the teams that execute work against the activities | Discussed additional: . | Voice Naming System working group (vertical and long lasting) . | the developer community wasn’t aligned that this is a priority | the VNS is key and central to the architecture in the Masterplan doc | agreed that we should discuss VNS and validate need -this discussion will be led by the Architecture working group plus others. Forming the VNS working group is TBD based upon this discussion | . | Privacy working group (horizontal)-combine with Security | Security working group (horizontal) – combine with Privacy | Identity &amp; Authentication working group (horizontal) | . | . Agreed to start: . | Architecture working group (S. Baul, M. Lens-FitzGerald, J.Iwasz, P.Bentsen, J.Larson, S.Prayaga, D.Cundiff) | Voice Naming Systems working group (pending further discussion) | Privacy &amp; Security working group –horizontal (S.Prayaga, J.Maas, P. Bentsen, M.Frazzini, N.Myers, L.Lin) | . Agreed that the working groups will define the lead for each . Discussed what OVN community members can/should participate in the Tech Comm working groups. Jim and Maarten will reach out to the communities to seek participation. Leadership will come from Tech Comm working groups .

Stine, A.Dalloul, J.Crabb, S.Nicholas, S.Prayaga, V.Tai, N.Latwis, A.Lee . The meeting was brought to order at 8:32 CDT (US). Antitrust statement – Jon Stine . Organizational updates and introductions/questions – Jon Stine . | Jon shared that the OVN is now a funded, legal entity. A directed fund of The Linux Foundation | The OVN Steering committee held first meeting on 6/1/20 and approved the OVN Chair, Tech Advisory Chair and the OVN initial budget | Microsoft has joined Ali Dalloul attending Tech Comm meeting today. Wegman’s has signed on as a sponsor as well | Jon shared the OVN organizational structure slide and slide covering how OVN committees and communities work together. Discussed that , “connected government” should be the term used instead of “smart cities;” public safety should be added to the communities slide. ACTION Jon to change “smart cities” to connected government, inclusive of public safety. | . Website development work and volunteers – Dan Cundiff . | OVN website created about a year ago [https://openvoicenetwork.org/] | Need volunteers to work on the OVN website and would prefer to have it done by the OVN community vs external resources | Need to post artifacts (charters, whitepapers, etc.) | Site leverages Hugo website, jamstack site, uses a template that allows for flexibility. Hosting provider is Netlify. For those that want to edit, use Netlify CMS | Nicholas Myers &amp; Mike Frazzini volunteered. ACTION: Jon will setup some time with Nick, Mike, and Dan | If others want to volunteer, please post in the OVN Technical Committee slack channel | . Forming, running, operating working groups for activities . | Activity is defined as a body of work that we need to work on and we need to form working groups to complete | We need to organize working groups, discuss how they will work and decide which activities we should work on first | The list of activities should map back to the Master Plan. If they do not, then should be brought back to the Tech Comm meeting for discussion on priority and updates to the Master Plan accordingly | Some of the items in the current activity list do not tie back to the Master Plan Discussion: | A.Dalloul –timelines and priorities would be helpful so supportive of the discussion | S. Baul –regular review of the Master Plan document would be helpful for new joiners and to foster continued alignment. Team agreed that this would be helpful and will ensure happens. ACTION: Setup review and on-boarding sessions as to the Master Plan, Activities List – Jon &amp; Dan | Dan walked through the docs repo in Git . | Technical Master Plan –North star, charter doc in markdown. Teams should do pull requests against this master plan | Proposed Activities list –point in time artifact that contains the list of activities that have been brought up for us to work on. Ideally, these activities tie to the Master Plan. We will need to create an additional roadmap artifact that takes what is in the Master Plan and says the order and likely when the artifacts will be completed | Ways of working doc explains how our working groups will do activities. Document is in progress and not yet complete | . | Activities list formed from discussions in Tech Comm meetings and from communities Discussion: | P. Bentsen –roadmap document will help to define interdependencies between working groups that would be helpful | A. Dalloul – Some of the areas are horizontal in nature and others are specific and some regulated. As we think about the intersection of these, it will be important to have a level of prioritization as we cannot go after everything while the Master Plan is being further developed. Perhaps a matrix for priorities and sequencing will be helpful | J.Larson – at the next developer community group meeting, they will be adding additional activities and will take a run at prioritization via a voting process. Then the priority list can be vetted against the Master Plan document. This can be brought back to the next Technical Committee meeting (6/26/20). | J.Stine – also can factor in whether an activity is horizontal or vertical as input to the priority | D.Cundiff - We can prioritize and sequence the work an do it in that order. Or we can allow additional, more periphery activities to be completed and submitted to the OVN | J.Larson - recommended that 2 classes of activities be identified –foundational and exploratory/community driven/pioneering. Emphasis needs to be on foundational but exploratory/community/pioneering driven will help attract new members, provide new ideas and allow to address fast changing space | General discussion was supportive of the 2 class method of foundational and exploratory with the emphasis on foundational. ACTION: Dan, Jon and Jim Larson to ID the activities as foundational or exploratory | . Forming &amp; Running of the working groups: . | Working group is a collection of people working on a activity or activities | Working groups can come and go and some are permanent pending the activity that they are assigned (ex. VRS) | Address things like: Slack Channel, release process, meeting cadence and notes, artifact publication process | The “how we work” may vary slightly from working group to working group (some things need to be consistent and others can vary) | Discussion: Team is supportive of a simple process and healthy for the success of the working group. Roles &amp; responsibilities and general operating agreement | Maarten Lens-FitzGerald, Samrat Baul and Jon Stine volunteered to create a proposal. Jon will include non-regulatory requirements like anti-trust, notes and recording (for audit trail). ACTION: Maarten, Samrat and Jon create proposal | . Discussion on the Master Plan and missing components. Team reiterated that PRs should be done against the Master Plan for this. Discussed that PRs are new to some. Discussed the reasons for git: version control, change tracking, transparency and common tech use. ACTION: Jon will setup a session on git, PRs, etc. Follow-up from 2020-05-29 meeting – outstanding issues – Dan Cundiff or Kristi Dank . | Will create a backlog grooming process outside of the Tech Comm meetings so that we can focus on priority items in the Tech Comm meetings. ACTION: Dan &amp; Kristi create process | Discussed why using git project board for tracking activities. Simple views to allow quick tracking of issues and transparency (work that needs to be done). | . Next Meeting: . | Review activity priorities | Propose working groups for top priority activities . | Meeting adjourned at 9:59 a.m. CDT (US) | . ",

Lin, K. Dank, J. Stine, B. Czechowicz, V.Tai, J. Eisenzopf, A. Weidauer . The meeting was brought to order at 8:30 CDT (US). Antitrust statement - Jon Stine . Introduction - Ways of Working document on Git - Jon Stine . J.Stine covered the Ways of Working document content (document itself is in Git). We can work towards building this out to include adding in our git PR processes, etc. ACTION: Please review Ways of Working document in git and provide comments. link to document OVN Docs git repo is now open so all should be able to access. ### Follow-up from 2020-05-14 meeting - outstanding issues - Kristi Dank . | Need to formalize the process for issue management, prioritization and discussion – defined process as part of 5/29 session. Will be added to ways of working doc. | Before the next technical committee meeting, participants to review the Technical Master Plan document, create PRs, add comments and be prepared to ratify. Will be discussed in 5/29 meeting | Meeting Feedback – participants to send comments in technical committee slack channel or send to D. Cundiff directly. Ongoing Discussed that all should be opening issues and we can use the git issue list and review material items in the tech comm meetings. We can leverage the projects feature of Git to aid with this management process. ACTION: D. Cundiff will add a few instructive notes to the ways of working doc. ACTION: Create this project view in git. Follow-up if everyone got the chance to review the Masterplan – M. Brinas-Dobrowski . Some changes were put into the Master Plan. We do want to label a release of this document. Discussion was supportive of a beta release. D. Cundiff will post the release in slack. We can add processes related to this to the Ways of Working document. DECISION: Confirm Master Plan as 0.1 Beta release. Review 1.0 proposed list of Tech Comm development projects – Jim . Following the Developer Community call, M. Lens-Fitzgerald and J. Larsen drafted a list of potential “activities” for Tech Comm consideration. The full list is still being developed. Suggest we use the term Activity vs Project to avoid confusion. Discussion was supportive of using the term Activity. VOCABULARY DECISION: These will be termed “activities” ACTION: J. Stine to add this to “Ways of Working.” List of suggested activities: 1 Destination Registry 1.1 Name Approaches for Voice Registry - Need to determine the best approach for developing a voice registry Discussion: This will be similar but not identical to DNS. D. Cundiff shared a few examples like operating aspects. Also do not be too confined to DNS and be sure to be forward looking. Registry aspects of VRS will need to be assessed too –may need separate firms to manage the voice registry. Collaborate with firms like Google &amp; Amazon (users of VRS). Expand the scope of this item to include a baseline of first level requirements vs Analysis. 2 Voice Commerce Core Processes 2.1 Pay by voice - Accelerating people’s purchasing process through voice payment, voice print and biometrics Discussion: Not a standard but a reference implementation and guidelines that firms can follow to provide the user with a more common experience. The soon to be stood-up voice designer community can help with this. Should this type of experience work come after foundational standards – this work may provide insights into how the lower level standards need to work. This work may also be applicable for other UI applications. Would be good to solicit involvement from bill-pay firms (ex. Capital-One) . | . 3 Identification and Authentication . Discussion: Biometrics included here? . 4 Data Privacy 4.1 Name Evaluate OVAL (Open Virtual Assistant Lab, Stanford University) Approach to Privacy – Need to specify a data privacy policy and enforcement mechanism . Discussion: Discussion supportive and promotes reuse. Will need to be in line with GDPR and CCPA. Perhaps combined with Identification and Authentication. Need to assess liability and regulatory impacts. 5 Interoperability Discussion: Should we add to interoperability a set of interfaces to interop between applications. 5.1 Vendor Independent language for writing speech applications . Discussion: This isn’t necessarily a new programming language but rather a vendor independent API specification. Like Jovo –a framework. Could be an open source toolkit. Voice assistant, IVRs or on-device apps. Will need to get Amazon and Google on board here (VII). Will need to put boundaries on the focus of this like channel, NLP, etc. This may not be an essential building block item. Meeting feedback . | Didn’t get through all agenda items | Need someone to monitor chat and share out | Good discussion today –got into some requirement and maybe use this meeting to do higher level inputs | Perhaps a stacked or forced ranked process may be helpful to prioritize efforts | organic nature feels ok now | Helpful to have a location for sharing existing knowledge/articles/links. Action: Dan will create an approach | . ",

Angerer, M. Lens-Fitzgerald, J. Maas, A. Lee, N. Sharif, L. Lin, S. Nicholas (Linux Foundation), K. Dank, J. Stine. The meeting was brought to order at 08:31 CDT (US). J. Stine announced that the meeting would be managed in accord with the antitrust guidelines of The Linux Foundation, (https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy/), and that the meeting would be recorded (mp3 file found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J_XGKcVnHqyVdWiV9wYjwh8rO8HMCJ3t). 1 Linux Foundation Definition of “Project” . S. Nicholas of The Linux Foundation reviewed the LF concept of Technical Charter, and the specific “Vocabulary and Definitions” charter now before the OVN Technical Committee. He noted that the OVN has the ability to define and launch additional projects as needs arise. There are three (3) primary reasons why a new project may be needed: Different mission/scope IP framework needs to be different Overall constituency of developers needs to be different. The OVN may need an additional project when the OVN identifies a standard that needs to be developed; at that point, discussion as to the need or a separate project is appropriate. LF process for project definition/determination described by S. Nicholas as “light;” OVN urged not to let concerns about LF processes be a burden or slow things down. Additional questions should be addressed to S. Nicholas or J. Stine. 2 Update on OVN Communities and their Role . J. Stine described the creation, growth of OVN Communities – comprised of the voice developer-designer-strategist ecosystem, and now in overlapping Slack Channels: Developers, Designer-Strategists, Europe, Health &amp; Life Sciences, and Ethical Use. Each community headed by volunteer moderators; Developer Community moderated by Tech Comm participants J. Larson, J. Herndon, M. Lens-Fitzgerald. Those wishing to participate in the Communities should forward a request to J. Stine. 3 OVN Technical Committee Ways of Working . D. Cundiff led a discussion of the tools and processes to be used by the OVN Technical Committee. There are 3 primary tools: Gsuite: the current repository for meeting minutes and participant roster. Let J. Stine know your Gmail email address to get added. Slack: the current real-time messaging and document sharing tool. With the exception of calendar/meeting notices, we will seek to migrate away from the use of e-mail. Let J. Stine know your email address to get added to Slack. Github: the working document repository – where we do our work. Let J. Stine know your github.com user name or share it in the Technical Committee slack channel OVN has a variety of repos. A few are currently marked as private but want to convert to open and goal to do this after we ratify the Master Plan document D. Cundiff demonstrated the use, processes within GitHub. ’d the process in Git S. Baul noted he has Git access but hasn’t tried any of the PRs. He is assuming this is OK and confirmed ok . A discussion of Tech Comm process, ways of working: J. Larson spoke to the process for “opened up” issues within GitHub related to the Master Plan. These are tracked outside of the document itself and not a PR for the doc. Per D. Cundiff: Participants can use the PR process to start a discussion about potential changes to a document vs opening an issue. Participants can use an issue for dialog on something that is not quite firm or you have questions Action: need to formalize the process for issue management/discussion. Likely part of the Tech Comm meetings going forward. Will also need a process re: prioritization of issues.J. Stine to add this to the “How we work” document now in development. Action: should GitHub training be desired, please let J. Stine know, he will setup a session. 4 Review of the Technical Masterplan . D. Cundiff discussed the need, timing of another round of reviews to the Technical Masterplan, as found in GitHub. Per D. Cundiff: We want to get the Masterplan to a good, complete V1 –a released state. Action: before the next Tech Comm meeting in 2 weeks, participants are to review the document, create PRs, add comments, and be prepared to ratify. Question from J. Larson: should the Developer community review the vocabulary together to land on PRs/recommendations. Yes, confirmed; this was agreed to as a good approach. Question raised by D. Cundiff, M. Brinas-Dobrowski regarding Master Plan visibility: private v public – aligned to keeping private for 2 months. Comments: M. Frazzini – 2 months; J. Iwasz – 2 months of time to get this more complete would be good before repo goes public; M. Buck – supports 2 month timeframe; M. Lens-Fitzgerald – there is an opportunity for marketing OVN in general with this document. Would be good if we announced that with an artifact that is public; S. Baul - reserve opinion at this point; J, Maas –agree with timeline and transparency with going public will help with momentum; J. Crabb – 2 months to allow for 1st Steering committee meeting. Initial Discussion: Top Three Projects / Working Groups . D. Cundiff, J. Stine introduced topic of top three projects. D. Cundiff reminded participants that the Technical Master Plan is the highest level of what we’ll need to work on. Action: Please put ideas in Technical Committee slack channel before next meeting on 5/29. Ideas, Comments: . J. Larson: Specify a voice application in a vendor-independent manner that can be transformed to both a working Alexa or Google voice application. Recommend if we should develop a vendor-independent language for writing speech applications that can be translated to be executed on both Alexa and Google platforms. Evaluate Almond as a possible voice-assistant platform. Identify structures and processes useful in our work. Reference: ALMOND, THE OPEN, PRIVACY-PRESERVING VIRTUAL ASSISTANT https://oval.cs.stanford.edu/ Dan responds: This is viable. I really like the interoperability theme. I think that’s future looking. Is Stanford asking you to do this as part of prod management planning? Specify the vocabulary for a frequently-used business activity by constructing and deploying a skill (printing a portion of a conversation) An example approach is outlined in Telephone Commands in five languages, Final draft ETSI ES 202 076 V2.1.1 (2009-06) ETSI Standard Human Factors (HF); User Interfaces; Generic spoken command vocabulary for ICT devices and services https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_es/202000_202099/202076/02.01.01_50/es_202076v020101m.pdf . P. Bentsen: [Enhanced/Augmented Audio (Audio Input/Voice Analysis): Specify audio solution requirements (HW, DSP, ASR/STT, AI, VRS, Wake Word, DB, etc.) to a level allowing for remote sensing, voice analysis and user/patient diagnostics, as well as interoperability and interfacing with relevant entities via VRS. This would obviously require CLEAR privacy controls/deterministic privacy and a heavy focus on privacy and data protection, cybersecurity and information security (Amongst use cases, are for H&amp;LS Digital Health, Telemedicine/Remote Patient Monitoring and Public Safety support, potentially other verticals).[Privacy &amp; Data Protection] . Privacy &amp; Data Protection (+Deterministic Privacy): Specify Privacy &amp; Data Protection requirements/baselines. Privacy and Data Protection should be foundational and pervasive in all parallel OVN efforts towards standardization and will likely become a regulatory requirement and enforced in the intermediate term for this space as well (GDPR, HIPAA/HITECH/HITRUST, etc). Cybersecurity: Specify Cybersecurity and information security requirements/baselines. Cybersecurity and information security should be foundational and pervasive in the OVN efforts towards standardization (Security Architecture &amp; Engineering, Communication &amp; Network Security, Identity &amp; Access Management, Asset/SW Security). M. Saul: Focus on Voice Registry System ; +1 Nicholas Myers . M. Lens-FitzGerald: Not sure that VNS is the biggest priority –wants to know why we think this needs to happen; Holistic view on voice (what is lacking in the technical plan); - Alexa VS talking lights switches (command and control VS conversational services); - Trans modal; - International views and applications, ie China, India, Europe . | Other stakeholder ie governments, defense, enterprise; Local language/nlu/data sets; Synthetic voice ; Data /profile manipulation; Inclusion are just preferences; Suggested that Maarten open up issues for some of these. | . M. Frazzini: Privacy &amp; Security, Interoperability, Voice Registry System . J. Iwasz: Working committees should be defined as horizontal or vertical; Will be helpful to create working groups by industry; IVR systems. M. Buck: Wake words standards. N. Myers: Voice Registry System; Data privacy and Security; Voice “handbook” for the industry; Research on desired use of voice technology versus how it is being used today. S. Baul: Voice Registry Service –wants to be sure that the “why” we are going this is strong as will be a lot of work and want to be sure that it will be used; Truth in what we are doing – how do we ensure that there is truth in adopting the standards. What is the case for standards compliance? Firms need to be motivated to adopt. Standard in measurement of voice quality. J. Maas: Will contribute via Slack. Process question- should we move these working group ideas from Slack to the MasterPlan? Action: if you find items missing from the Masterplan, then do a PR. Please continue to post these in Slack . Question: A. Lee–is the OVN focused on a voice assistant, or does the scope extend to IVR’s, more operational use cases? . 6 Meeting Feedback: Regarding applause, criticism, and recommendations going forward: please place comments in Technical committee slack channel or relay directly to Dan via Slack if preferred.

Stine opened the meeting, welcomed Tech Com newcomers. ANTITRUST POLICY. J. Stine announced that the meeting of the Tech Comm would be conducted according to the Antitrust Policy of The Linux Foundation, found here: https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy/ . REVIEW OF LOGISTICS / ACTIONS FROM PRIOR MEETING. D. Cundiff reviewed the following: Technical Committee setup in Slack. Reach out if questions with getting access. Ensure you have access to OVN Github organization as most of our technical committee artifacts will be housed there. If new to Git, go to github.com to sign up for a user name and relay that information to Dan/Jon. Pull Request (PR) – if you want to make a change, have it reviewed and merged in. REVIEW OF LINUX FOUNDATION PROJECT CHARTER. On behalf of the LF’s Scott Nicholas, J. Stine reported; This is the official statement of what an official TLF project is. Scott has authored this –will review in following meeting as Scott unable to attend today. MASTER PLAN – VOCABULARY REVIEW. M. Brinas-Dobrowski led a continued v1 review of vocabulary as generated from prior conversations, and as captured in the Master Plan 1.0. Reviewed list of vocabulary compiled to date. Action: All - Please review and share any comments /edits or do a PR against the vocab doc. General Vocab – key updates since last meeting: Conversational AI –Let’s align on this definition; Query; Automatic Speech Recognition; Component Vocab – key updates since last meeting; Natural Language Processing; Intent; Entity; Voice Registry System; Dialog Broker; Dialog Manager; . Discussion: Interaction Model Concept – part of NLP but need to validate; Dialog Element –need to validate if needs to be added; 3 forms of interoperability – need further discussion before adding (J. Larson); Domain skills – need to define and add. Landed on Voice Application (S. Prayaga); Dialog Broker – clarification on definition (N. Myers); Dialog Manager – clarification on definition (N. Myers). Media Player – specific functions on a platform level that cannot be done on a local level (voice application). Aligned that this is part of dialog broker (M. Lens-FitzGerald). MASTER PLAN 1.0. D. Cundiff, M. Brinas-Dobrowski led an introduction, initial review of the Tech Comm Master Plan. Shared document is a starting point for continued development, evolution. Will follow Symantec versioning scheme. Goal is to break down the components in the doc to kick off work streams to accomplish. Doc Overview: . Solution/Principles: We will need to validate our standards by creating reference implementations; Can be implemented as open source or closed source products; Abstracted to the right level as to not too deeply specify particular technologies used to implement them; Has the ability to protect the privacy of the user AND the user can know where their privacy is protected or not – is discoverable; Standards can be implemented down to the individual –as low as localhost, a private network or as big as globally provided. Discussion: M. Lens-Fitzgerald: appreciates the reference to the web and basing the work that we do on that; A lot has changed since the web beginning like privacy or inclusion. If we look at the past, what can we learn from and add to our solution. Center for Humane Technology. John Iwasz - Heidi Culbertson is an excellent resource for input for voice application design for accessibility. Many comments in chat in support of accessibility focus. Conclusiveness &amp; abuse should be factored in. S. Prayaga: Interoperability /multiple assistants –how are we dealing with privacy and data management? . M. Frazzini: Great first draft. As we discuss the important topic of privacy, we also need to talk about security. Aligned that we need to add security as a principle. J. Iwasz: We should leverage existing /review existing standards such as NIST and determine what could apply to voice. P. Bentsen: Propose adding voice quality – may be necessary to review what quality measures or what quality of service needs to be in place in order for standards to be utilized (related to diagnostics on voice input). Design: Component architecture overview; Component Flow ; Channel TTS/STT; NLP. NLP will determine your location and your who is being referred to. Voice Registry Service: Making list of invocation names public; Location sensitive; Is a global service . J. Larson: we should capture the requirements for the VRS. Included in the master doc? No, this will be done via technical sub-committees as we break out the work and the VRS sub-committee will tackle. Suggest adding to the master plan document how we will do the work –sub committees –in Abstract and we can build out further . J. Herndon: As we break out the sub-committees-there will need to be interaction between /across sub-committees. NEXT STEPS AND ACTIONS. Prior to next meeting – Committee members: Please review the vocabulary list and share any comments /edits or do a PR against the vocab doc. Please read Master Plan document - and open issues or do pull requests in Github. Comment in slack if unable to use Github. Come to the next meeting with an idea of which projects that should be priority projects for OVN to focus upon. Think about what role you would like to perform within the Technical Committee as there are many opportunities. Prepare for roundtable discussion as to your three highest priority projects).

Meeting opened at 08:32 Central US. WELCOME. D. Cundiff opened meeting. REVIEW OF THE AGENDA. STATEMENT OF ANTITRUST COMPLIANCE. S. Nicholas affirmed that the meeting would operate under the Antitrust Guidelines of The Linux Foundation, as found here: https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy/ . LAUNCHING THE TECHNICAL COMMITTEE WORK. D. Cundiff emphasized the importance of asynchronous team productivity outside of regularly scheduled meetings. To do so, will use three primary tools: Slack GSuite Share Drive – used for documents that do not require team critique, editing, version control; a Share Drive file has been set up for the OVN Tech Comm team Github – Technical committee will use Github to track the work that we need to do as well as artifacts that need version control and markups/comments. Tech Comm will follow a pull request (PR) approach for this. OVN TECH COMM MASTER PLAN 0.1. D. Cundiff, M. Brinas-Dobrowski reviewed 0.1 draft. Document context: leveraged the research that has been done to date and is a summary of that information; seeks to be an artifact that lays out the technical opportunities for standardization. Does try to define or outline the standards at a high level. Document components include abstract, principles, design, vocabulary , component architecture proposal, component flow, component details. Process for review: Will be converted to markdown and placed in Github. Link sent out via Slack in ~1 week. Reviewers execute PR to add comments. Next discussion on 4/17, with these objectives: * review in more detail * ratify the components * get to a baselined Masterplan v1.0.0. VOCABULARY DESERVING OF MECE DEFINITION. D. Cundiff led roundtable discussion; noted that, in first meeting, the Tech Comm aligned that defining our vocabulary made good sense to do at the start. Since, Tech Comm members contributed vocabulary content to feed this discussion. D. Cundiff and M. Brinas-Dobrowski reviewed the vocabulary used in the 0.1 Masterplan document. Included: Utterance - spoken or typed phrases; Wake Word - a specific word that will catch the attention of the channel; Query - the words that the user is requesting to happen; Text-to-Speech (TTS) - TTS is a text converting to audio. It includes customized models to overcome common speech recognition barriers, such as unique vocabularies, speaking styles, or background noise; Speech-to-Text (STT) - STT is converting the response from an audio to a text; Channels – An interface and origin of communication. It is where the utterances originate; Natural Language Processing (NLP) - A service and a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers communicate with humans in their language and scales other language-related tasks. NLP helps to structure highly complicated, unstructured human utterance and vice-versa; Intent - is a part of the structured machine translation. It is the identified action that the machine interprets based on the user’s query; Entity - is a part of the structured machine translation. It is a custom level data type and considered a concrete value to associate a word in a query; Voice Registry System (VRS) - It is a global entity type in OVN and considered one of the most important offerings. It is a hierarchical registry system built on an open system similar to the Domain Name System (DNS). VRS transforms and associates the VRS names to dialog management endpoints, NLP providers, and the functionalities you get from the dialog broker. The VRS URL serves consistently regardless of the NLP. Dialog Broker (DB) - It is responsible for providing the fulfillable intents available for a resolved VRS record (e.g. where resolved VRS record “Target”, it’s fulfillable intents might be “order product, check order status, add to shopping list”. These fulfillable intents can execute remotely on the DM or download locally on the device. Dialog Manager (DM) - It handles the dynamic response of the conversation. It provides a more personalized response based on the action provided by the NLP to send back to the user Roundtable comments, contributions: . M. Saul: Voice Name Systems – maps to VRS. Open, Interoperability, Data Privacy. J. Larson: Assistant (agent) – maps to channel; Intent – see above. Agent Interoperability – an agent can be replaced by another agent –rename to channel interoperability; Platform Interoperability- agent can run different platforms; Component Interoperability – component can be replaced by another component; Wake-up word – maps to wake word; Wake-up word Registry – maps to voice registry system. J. Iwasz: Natural Language –maps to utterance; Voice Application – maps to dialog manager; Smart Speaker – maps to channel; Localization – internationalization, changing speech understanding and response to match local user. The Synthesized voice –the voice that is typically used on voice channels in a text-to-speech scenario; Speech-to-Text-see above; Text-to-Speech –see above. N. Myers: Utterance - see above; Interaction Model – will need to define for us leveraging what google, etc. have. Between the user and the channel; Artificial Intelligence – will need to define; Interactive Voice Response – will need to define but lower priority; IVR may be siloed to a channel/channel specific and OVN may cross channels; Meant for definition only, not for creating standards to IVRs; Conversational AI; Natural Language Understanding vs. Natural Language Processing – see above; Voice User Interface – maps to channel. A. Weidauer: Natural Language Processing –see above; Dialog Elements – the equivalent to HTML, header or footer or form/paragraph that make up the website. For voice, we will need to define what we mean by Dialog Elements as most discussions are not 1 question and 1 answer. For a non-linear conversation. Text-to-Speech – see above. Speech-to-Text – see above. Conversational Interface – maps to channel. QUESTIONS AND OPEN ISSUES. NEXT STEPS. Publish meeting notes and first draft of the vocabulary. Will be posted on GitHub so we can do PRs against to contribute. If questions on Github and PRs, reach out to Dan. Members asked to review vocabulary and contribute via comments, issues, etc. In Github. Masterplan will be published and ask members to review ahead of 4/17 meeting. Submitted 3 April 2020 . ",

    "title": "Why the Open Voice Network?",
    "content": "The Open Voice Network was founded on these beliefs: . | We are in the early days of voice assistance. We believe the future of voice assistance is “multi” – a world of innumerable enterprise conversational agents operating across multiple platforms, accessed through multiple types of devices, accompanied by multiple modalities, and contextually integrated. Today, the world of voice assistance is dominated by proprietary, cloud-centric platforms (and related devices) that deliver services using closed implementations. While closed systems can create value for stakeholders and selected partners, a lack of standards-based interoperability and governance restricts the growth (and economic value) of a larger voice ecosystem. | A broad lack of user trust inhibits investment and innovation in voice. A significant barrier to the realization of user value in voice assistance is the lack of trust that users (from consumers to patients to enterprise decision-makers) have in current voice processes and providers. | Standards can only emerge from an open, neutral, and communal perspective. Proposed standards will gain the greatest support (and eventual adoption) when such standards are developed through the leadership of an open, neutral, third party – one dedicated to the best for the most. The name “Open Voice Network” speaks to two core operating principles. The first is that OVON is “open” – transparent in its work, and neutral in its interests. The second is that OVON is a network of voice user communities – inclusive of aspirations and concerns from enterprises to voice developers and designers, data analysts and ethicists, marketers and media, and voice platforms worldwide. | Standards create trust and unlock value. The introduction of communally-developed and broadly adopted standards and guidelines is essential to the creation of trust – and in turn, the realization of the technology’s full societal value. | . The Open Voice Network is Voice First . The Open Voice Network is Voice First. We are language-centric, conversationally-focused, and cognizant of the variety and richness of voice data. We are also user-centric, inclusive (believing that voice is for all), and desirous of voice being a tool for societal good. We recognize that voice will be increasingly combined with other digital modalities of communication and conversation, such as screen-based visuals, gestures, and facial recognition. However: to focus our work and drive results, we will solve voice first. From Then to Today: the Rationale for the Open Voice Network . The idea that machines could talk with and listen to humans is far from a 21st century idea. The development of voice-based virtual assistants, often known as voicebots, reaches back at least to the 1960’s. Research into machine-based speech recognition began to bear fruit in the 1950’s. Exploration of speech synthesis – machines that could talk – has been traced all the way back to the late 18th century. Given the lengthy and rich history of machines that can talk and listen – a phenomenon we may today describe as voice assistance – it is vitally important that any entity wishing today to work in this space must study and understand prior research and existing standards. Prior to second decade of this century, voicebots most often served in interactive voice response (IVR) applications for telephony-based services, primarily in enterprise call centers. Numerous technical standards for voice recognition and speech synthesis were developed and broadly adopted during this time. A next era of voice – one defined by consumer-owned and -centered natural-language processing and a cloud-based solution architecture – was heralded by the 2011 launch of Apple’s Siri voice assistant and the 2014 launch of Amazon’s Alexa assistant on the new Echo device. The launch of the Echo also created an entirely new consumer digital device category – the in-home smart speaker. This device type has become the fastest-selling consumer electronics category of all time. Over the years, global annual wholesale shipments of smart speaker devices grew from roughly 9 million units in 2016 to a projected 136.9 million units in 2020 – a 72.36% CAGR. Such success prompted others to join the consumer voice market, and to expand the use of voice assistants into a wide range of enterprise use cases. Voice assistance – now defined largely by its new, user-owned capabilities – now extends well beyond the call center. It is increasingly an interface for machine and vehicle operation, factory management, and enterprise software. At the same time, voice assistance has – following the Apple model – become a standard feature on smartphones. More than 500 million units of Android-enabled smartphones enjoyed voice assistant functionality as of January 2020. Despite this remarkable growth over the past decade in capabilities, availability and adoption, it is largely believed by leading industry analysts that voice assistance is still in its early days. Voice experts suggest that we will soon see: . | Significant advances in voice assistant capabilities. The user experience of voice assistance will be transformed in multiple ways. Of most importance will be the shift from today’s command-and-question interaction to contextually-aware human-to-machine conversation. In practice, this will enable conversation akin to that with a friend, where shared history, time, place, sentiment, and personal preferences are brought seamlessly into the flow of a discussion. A voice assistant will not only understand what is said, but the context in which it is said and the emotion with which it is said – and be able to respond, recommend, and remember. Voice will also be combined with visual elements, to provide what experts term “multi-modal” conversation. This could range from information shown on screens to the recognition of gestures and facial behaviors. | Voice interfaces and conversational agents everywhere. Voice will become ubiquitous – the ever-device, everywhere interface to the digital world. Voice assistance will be integrated not only into devices of all types, but into places (homes, stores, banks, medical facilities, museums, stadiums) and systems for monitoring environments and processes, from factories to farms. Analysts predict active voice assistant use on more than two billion smartphones by 2023¹, and some 8.4 billion voice assistant users worldwide by 2024². Users will search for and speak to websites (more than 1.7 billion worldwide today³), and smart, connected objects (some 41 billion worldwide by 2025⁴.) Futurists see a world in which voice is the normative interface for all artificial intelligence; indeed, it is predicted that all artificial intelligence will be conversational.⁵ . | Market transitions in the AI-enabled voice ecosystem and value chain. A unique industry is now being created by world-leading technology firms through voice assistance. Voice is increasingly the entry point of a data-consuming engine of technology and economic growth. Hundreds of thousands (and in time, millions) of independently-developed and purpose-built enterprise and organizational voice assistants will emerge , each speaking and listening to constituents through a multitude of voice channels. This will reflect an important market transition, as voice shifts from a world bounded by platform-based skills and actions to one akin to today’s internet, with independent sites connecting to users across multiple global platforms. | The emergence of platform-independent voice assistants. This calls into question platform and assistant interoperability, in which an enterprise-owned independent assistant can speak with all others, regardless of platform or channel. It suggests a standardization of components, the building blocks of voice assistants – components that have emerged from many of the standards listed below. | Growing legislative and regulatory interest in voice. Numerous questions, on topics such as privacy, data ownership, data use, and so-called platform economics, are now being raised by western law-makers and regulators. | . In the summer of 2016, a team of academic researchers, consultants, and technology executives came together to explore the implications of this new world of voice. The 2016-2017 research posited that this new world of voice assistance could – and, in time, would – re-shape the relationship between an enterprise and its constituents (be they shoppers, clients, or patients.) It also suggested that this new world of user-centric voice assistance represented a significant market realignment, with voice evolving from a limited-purpose technology to the interface of a new, global system of AI-enabled virtual communication. This team was encouraged in this vision – then, as it is now – by the continued advancements in the technologies and linguistic research that enable voice assistance. However, it was quickly recognized that technology and linguistic innovation alone would not drive voice assistance to broad enterprise acceptance and substantial market growth. At least three other high-level dependencies were identified: . | Enterprise trust in a level playing field: a widely-accepted belief that voice is a technology through which all players could benefit, and that a communally-developed “rule of law” governs the interplay between members of the voice ecosystem. | Confidence in enterprise value creation, capture, and delivery: a widely-accepted belief – one based upon demonstrations and documentation of use cases – that voice assistance can and will provide a significant return on an enterprise investment. | An open technology ecosystem and architecture: the enabler of choice – the ability to select best-of-breed technologies with the confidence of interoperability. | . These dependencies begged (then and now) for broad governing standards. Especially standards (and protocols) that would enable the openness, user choice, inclusivity, and user trust so essential to the system’s growth and value. To a large degree, the state of voice assistance resembled the early, pre-standards “browser war” days of the internet. Vision of the Open Voice Network . To develop and drive adoption of the technical standards and usage guidelines that will make voice assistance worthy of user trust. Voice assistance is in its earliest days. It is rapidly moving toward a global future that will be multi-assistant, multi-platform, multi-device, multi-modal, and found in every industry. It promises significant value not only to voice providers, but to its users – the enterprises, marketers and communicators, operational managers, developers and designers, and billions of individuals worldwide. To realize its potential, conversational AI must be open and worthy of user trust. It must be open for development and innovation. It must be trust-worthy in its ease and reliability use, in its direct and unfiltered access to desired destinations, in its commercial and data usage and privacy, in its cross-platform interoperability, in lack of bias, in its development languages and protocols. Through the centuries, the development and adoption of standards has repeatedly sparked ever-advancing use, innovation, ecosystem development, and economic growth for new technologies. We, the sponsors and supporters of The Open Voice Network, believe that now – at the dawn of conversational AI’s multi-platform future – is the time to communally develop and drive toward adoption the conversational AI standards that will enable user trust. The history of the World Wide Web (WWW) is instructive for the Open Voice Network and the future of voice assistance. In the early days of the World Wide Web, user experience was shackled by closed implementations (e.g., AOL, etc). Thankfully, open standards such as the Domain Name System (DNS) and industry-wide bodies such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) unleashed the potential of the web, and it became the extraordinarily valuable and innovative ecosystem we know today. We believe that voice-enabled devices and services will exponentially expand in use and value when provided a set of open standards. Development and adoption of such standards will prevent users from re-creating basic functionalities, and enable providers, innovators, and enterprises to focus their investments on innovation and usage differentiation. In addition, a voice ecosystem that is open, inclusive, and trust-worthy may also need new governance systems and capabilities, such as: . | a Voice Registry Service (VRS) | Dialog Brokers, Dialog Managers, and other new components | Privacy controls and standard ways to communicate and disclose this to users. | . Furthermore, like the open standards that made the World Wide Web successful, these standards would aim to have these traits: . | Open development from and through a community of regional, language, and gender diversity; | Open management by an open committee with a neutral governing entity | Can have an open-source reference implementation | Can be implemented as open-source and/or closed source products and services | Abstracted at the right level as to not too deeply specify particular technologies used to implement them | . The Guiding Values of the Open Voice Network . Standing before the growth of conversational AI in usage and economic value are four broad issues: . Trust, choice, inclusivity, and openness. Trust opens the door to personal and enterprise adoption, and to ever-more complex usage by all users – from individuals to developers and designers to enterprise decision-makers. The foundation of user trust is a “rule of law” which best emerges from the neutral, industry-driven development of standards and standards-based systems. Such a rule of law includes standards to protect the user’s privacy and security, provide visibility to data and data use, and enable consent processes for data use and sharing; it also asserts standards and guidance for data use (both personal and commercial), inclusivity and accessibility, and system governance. The Open Voice Network’s stated mission is to make voice worthy of user trust. Choice is a catalyst for ecosystem innovation and the growth of value for individuals, developers and designers, and enterprises of all sizes. Choice is realized in many ways – in a user’s ownership and control of data, in a user’s choice of components, assistants and providers, and in the choice of assistant architecture (be it hosted locally or in the cloud.) . Inclusivity is about everyone having a voice, and in every situation. It is voice that welcomes under-represented vocalizations and dialects; voice that advances access for everyone. Openness enables interoperability among assistants and providers. At its core is the identification and definition of standardized development building blocks. Such blocks serve as a foundation for commercial differentiation and value; they can be assembled according to purpose, and in completely open, completely proprietary, or mixed (or hybrid) implementations. OVON’s Ways of Working are Based Upon Our Core Values . | We are neutral and inclusive, welcoming to participation and sponsorship all members of the conversational AI industry – from independent developers and designers to enterprise users to technology firms and platform providers. | We seek broad participation and communal development. No one company or person will set the direction of Open Voice Network proposed standards or usage guidelines. | We work collaboratively with standards bodies and existing industry organizations. | We adhere to an open process: collaborative, communal, balanced development; broad consensus in decision-making; transparency in decisions and documentation. | We seek technological solutions that . | can have an open-source reference implementation | can be implemented through open source and/or proprietary-source products and services | are abstracted at the right level, as to not too deeply specify particular technologies or providers | provide commercial providers and entrepreneurs the room necessary for innovation and differention. | . | . Standards and Usage Guidelines: An Aspirational List . The Technical Advisory Council of The Open Voice Network is responsible for determining OVON’s research and development of technical standards and usage guidelines. It reports to the Open Voice Network Steering Committee. These topics are in exploration: . ",

Example Use Case(s) for Resolution . The Open Voice Network will test its proposed solutions against aspirational enterprise use cases from the vertical industries of the Open Voice Network: commerce (retail and consumer goods), media, transportation, financial services, health and life sciences, public safety, connected cities, and education. Commerce: . The enterprise: a multi-line retailer of goods and services with more than 50 million monthly active customers. The customer base is 65% female, 35% male; speaks seven primary languages, with multiple dialects; and actively uses conversational AI to connect to the retailer through smartphones (40%), automobiles (30%), smart speakers (25%) and smart appliances (5%). Customers of this retailer use voice to establish and manage retailer club membership; place and pay for weekly replenishment orders; place and pay for unique orders; place and pay for prescription drug/pharmacy orders; place and pay for media and streaming services; manage orders and service scheduling-reservations with affiliated service providers; manage access real-time information as to order status and shipment; obtain household value information, ranging from recipes to beverage recommendations to new-born and infant care; obtain use and how-to information from branded product vendors. Customers will transact with this retailer using a wide range of payment options. The retailer considers all data within its customer interactions and transactions to be proprietary. 1.0 Project Definition and Intellectual Property Licensing . Since its incorporation in May 2020, the Open Voice Network Technical Committee has operated within a Linux Foundation-chartered Project entitled PROJECT 1.0: VOCABULARY AND DEFINITION. The stated remit of Project 1.0 is to name, operationally define, and prioritize the potential areas for standards development within the realm of artificial intelligence-enabled voice assistance in a manner that is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE), and for OVON Steering Committee review. The purpose of Project 1.0 is to establish a foundational floor of guidance for Technical Committee organization, talent recruitment, and resourcing. Project 1.0 operates according to a Creative Commons (CC) Attribution 4.0 license. Initial Areas of OVON Standards and Usage Research . Voice Registry System . One of the most important standards that gave rise to the World Wide Web (WWW) is the Domain Name System (DNS), the hierarchial and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. Since its initial implementation in 1985, the DNS has translated readily memorized domain names to the numerical internet protocol addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices. The need for a DNS-like system for voice, one that could connect explicit requests for specific destinations to a third-party conversational agent or voice application, has been part of OVON participant conversations since 2017. Soon after the incorporation of the Open Voice Network in May 2020, a Work Group was formed by the OVON Technical Committee, and tasked with evaluation of “the market/need opportunity for a global, platform-agnostic voice destination registry.” If such an opportunity was found, the Work Group was asked to “identify and define the capabilities of such a registry in preparation for the formation of an OVON Project.” . Introduction to the VRS. Voice Registry System (VRS) is the new concept that is part of the open-voice standards. VRS is a new global entity and, therefore, part of the pre-processing identification in the NLP. Once the NLP identifies @vrs, it passes the information to the VRS server. The job of the VRS is to resolve the query by trying to resolve first in the root server. If not found, it is smart enough to point to the next name server, and this process continues until the request is resolved, or determined that the requested @vrs is not registered. For more information and details about VRS, please go to this document. Voice-Specific Privacy and Security . Concerns regarding the privacy of voice assistant conversations (and the subsequent use of conversational data) has been repeatedly identified by user research and voice industry analysts as a major issue inhibiting voice use at individual and enterprise levels. (See Kinsella; add details here) In early, summer 2020 meetings of the OVON Technical Committee, it was decided to form a Work Group to “identify, defined, and prioritze the capabilities that the OVON must ‘design in’ to its other work in regards to individual privacy and data security.” . In addition to its advisory role to the VRS and Architecture Work Groups, it was also determined in subsequent meetings that a Privacy and Security Work Group could bring benefit to the OVON and the industry at large by developing neutral, platform-agnostic guidelines for the protection of legislated and regulated privacy rights, and the promotion of widely-held privacy values. To meet this broad remit, the OVON Privacy and Security Work Group began its work in Q3 2020 with the study of the critical legislation and regulation that now governs individual privacy, as well as highly-cited third party privacy guidelines and those of leading voice assistant providers. (A list of references follows.) . additional content as of 2021.01.03 to be added here. Component Definition and Interface Interoperability . The interoperability of voice assistance platforms and conversational agents – one with the ease of use of today’s multi-browser internet – is at the heart of the OVON’s vision of an open, accessible voice ecosystem that is worthy of user trust. With this in mind, the OVON Technical Committee formed in the Summer of 2020 an Architecture Work Group, tasked to “identify, define, and prioritize common voice assistant components for potential standardization”. The Architecture Work Group began its efforts by studying the architectures and components of several independent voice assistant concepts, including those of the the W3C Voice Interaction Community and the Stanford Open Voice Assistant Lab (OVAL), seeking to identify and define the common “building block” components of voice assistance.

    "title": "Components and Artifacts",
    "content": "Each voice agent contains several components such as those illustrated in Figure C1. Each component consumes artifacts from previous components and produces artifacts for use by later components. For example, the TTS component will accept text artifacts as input and produce speech artifacts as output. Each component should have a standard format for its input and output artifacts so a component can be easily replaced or reused. Flexibility . We will define the formats for artifacts (but not the algorithms that convert, consume, and produce artifacts). By standardizing artifact formats, we enable the replacement of components by other components that process input artifacts and product output artifacts faster, more efficiently, or more accurately. For example, a speech recognition component algorithm based on the hidden Markov model can be replaced by a neural network model. Every voice agent contains components that consume and manipulate artifacts. If components in different voice agents produce and consume artifacts in standard formats, artifacts can be shared across voice agents. We will define the formats for input and output artifacts of voice processing components such as ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition which converts speech to text), NLP (used to extract semantics from text produced by ASR), DM (dialog manager which processes the semantics), and TTS (which converts text to spech). Note that we do not specify the algorithms inside each component; technology vendors compete by providing alternative algorithms for components. Voice agent developers can select components from multiple vendors that fill the developers specific needs, and connect the selected components together because they communicate with each other using standardized artifacts. Here are some examples: . | In a smart home environment, it may be desirable to add speech recognition and encoding software to a microphone. (Figure C2) The microphone converts speech to digital text which is then encoded for security purposes before transmission to a network hub for further processing. Because text is more compact than speech, this approach saves transmission bandwidth. TTSs are often designed to perform well with a specific national language (North American English, German, etc.) | Figure C3 illustrates the replacement of an North American English TTS by a German TTS which pronounces German better than the English TTS | In order to accommodate a handicapped person who can not speak or hear well, the microphone and speaker are replaced by a keyboard and display in Figure C4. | . Interoperability . Interoperability enables one voice agent to use the data and functions of another voice agent. For example, a shopping agent collects user account information and then invokes a second agent, the validity agent. Information collected during the shopping agent needs to be copied to the validity agent in order to avoid having the validity agent solicit same information from the user again. In a more detailed example, Figure C5 illustrates the intents for an airline reservation voice agent and a hotel reservation voice agents and the resulting user dialogs. Note that the redundant turns (denoted in colors) in the user dialogs. The redundant turns can be removed from the user dialogs by copying slot values from the airline reservation voice agent to slots within the hotel reservation voice agent. Component Framework . In order to manage the big task of identifying and recommending standard formats for artifacts, we partition components into four baskets inspired by the advent and progress of automotive transportation. High-level descriptions of these four baskets and their possible components follows. (Figure C6) . 1. Macadam Road “Foundational” Component Basket (Core functionality) . Named after the 18th century Scottish engineer who invented the hard-surface, reliable road. This basket of components provides the basic infrastructure needed by voice agents.

    "title": "Design",
    "content": "Vocabulary . See OVON vocabularies. Examples . Several examples that are useful to explain all the concepts required in the design: . “Computer, please add milk to my shopping list at BigGrocery” . | machine translates to → {wakeword}, {query} {vrs} | intent: addShoppingList | entities: milk = @product | . “Computer, ask BigGrocery to add milk to my shopping list” . | translates to → {wakeword}, {vrs} {query} | intent: addShoppingList | entities: milk = @product | . Component Architecture . Note: Dialog Broker, VRS, and Dialog Manager are new concepts. NLP, TTS / STT, and Channels are things that already exist, but we list them because they will be affected and influenced by the standards. Component Flow . This component flow section aims to describe the general steps that happen in and between each component. | “{wake word}, add milk to my shopping list at BigGrocery.” | NLP calls VRS and passes the query. NLP sends in the query its location and what it thinks the VRS name lookup should resolve for (in the case below it understands that “biggrocery” is what the VRS lookup is for). See Figure 1.0. | . { \"query\": \"add milk to my shopping list at biggrocery\", \"vrs_name_lookups\": [ { \"vrs_name\": \"biggrocery\"} ], \"channel_location\": { \"lat\": \"\", \"long\": \"\" }, \"channel\": \"app\", \"source_nlp_provider\": \"AmazonLex\" } . | The name lookup of the “biggrocery” is resolved in VRS. It will respond with the records for the dialog broker, dialog manager, and NLP for the given location(s) that were requested in the lookup. See Figure 2.0 and Figure 2.1. | NLP will call the Dialog Broker based on the endpoint it receives from the VRS. See Figure 3.0 | NLP identifies the intent and entities. If identified intent is not part of the fulfillable intents, NLP will do a default fail response. | . { \"intent\": \"addShoppingList\", \"entities\": [ { \"@product\" } ], \"query\": \"add milk to my list at biggrocery\" } . | If VRS returns the Dialog Manager endpoint, NLP will call the Dialog Manager to have a better dynamic response for the vendor. | . Component Details . This component details section aims to further define the individual components in more detail. Utterance . An utterance construct is: {wake word}, {query} . Wake Word . Wake word options: . | Static wake word | Trainable static wake word | Custom trainable wake word (e.g. instead of “Hey Google”, “Hey Johnny”) | Add another ecosystem’s wake word (Hey Google, Hey Alexa, Hey Siri, etc) to a device in addition to the wake word(s) already on the device (this would result in more than 1 wake word being on the device). This would require a standard given it’s an interface that would need standardization. | . Query . The words that the user is using after the wake word. The query can have multiple constructs. Examples: . | {invocation} | {launch phrase} {explicit invocation} | {launch phrase} {implicit invocation} | . Channel . Channel is the physical or virtual interface to the user where the dialog between the computer and the user occurs (e.g. a physical device, a web page, apps, etc). It is responsible for receiving voice input from a user and delivering back a potentially personalized response using inputs from TTS and the Dialog Manager. It manages the specific native framework such as cards to provide a better user experience and address some visual nuisances to individual channels. STT / TTS . Speech To Text (STT) is the component of the architecture that converts the audio to text. It applies a deep-learning AI algorithm to apply knowledge about noise robustness, phrase hints, spelling, language structure, and global vocabulary of any utterances. Text To Speech (TTS) is the opposite of the STT. It translates a text to a more synthesized natural-sounding speech. The TTS is the component that creates a simulated conversation with the user. Both STT, and TTS can be implemented on the cloud, on-premise, or embedded devices based on what the technology offers. There are multiple known STT / TTS technologies in the industry such as Watson STT, Google Cloud, Microsoft, and Mozilla Deepspeech. This is another domain where OVON can play a significant role in influencing the standard schema for all the STT / TTS technologies players. Previously-developed and broadly-adopted standards that have shaped STT and TTS development include Web Speech API (a JavaScript API that allows web developers to incorporate speech recognition and synthesis into their web pages), Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0 (a standard way to control presentation of speech such as pronunciation, volume, pitch rate, etc. across different synthesis-capable platforms), Proununciation Lexicon Specification Version 1.0 (a syntax for specifiying pronunciation lexicons to be used by Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis engines in voice browser applications), Emotion Markup Language (Emotion ML) 1.0 (a “plug-in” language suiteable for use in three different areas: 1) manual annotation of data, 2) automatic recognition of emotion-related stsates from user behavior; and 3) generation of emotion-related system behavior), anbd ToBI (a set of conventions for transcribing and annotating the prosody of speech.). NLP . As we enter the era of human-machine conversation, the crown jewel component of it is Natural Language Processing. The problem we are facing today is the lack of standards from different NLP providers. In the world of open-standard, we are introducing the concept of a global entity, i.e., @vrsname. It is not about primitive data types that individual NLP understands but a smart object that all NLP providers understand. In the pre-processing stage of NLP, it is evaluating the query as a whole and identifying if any global identity exists in the query. The identified global entity is submitted to the VRS. The global identity solves the interoperability aspect of NLPs. For example, the word “BigGrocery” in Amazon NLP is going to be treated the same way in Microsoft Luis or Einstein. Like domain names, this gives businesses the flexibility to be handled identically in the world of the human-machine conversation regardless of the NLP provider they choose. NLP schema is another place where OVON can influence the standard. Different NLPs have their own set of schema that leads to the different implementation of standards. Some NLPs understand the concept of entity, but some do not. Some understand the intent, and some have different flavors of it and call it “action.” Because of the closed implementations, each business has to orchestrate this separately or build their abstracted implementation version to be able to adapt to different NLP standards. OVON is proposing to set a standard schema for all NLP to follow: . { \"response_id\": UUID, \"query\": \"add one milk to my shopping list at biggrocery\", // raw version of the user inquiry \"query_result\": { \"intents\": [ // list of intents related to the query { \"name\": \"addShoppingList\", \"display_name\": \"add shopping list\", \"confidence_score\": 0.9999, \"is_top_score\": \"true\" }, { \"name\": \"orderList\", \"display_name\":\"order shopping\" \"confidence_score\": 0.7982 \"entities\": [ //list of entities related to the query { \"one\": \"sys.integer\" }, { \"milk\": \"@product\" } ], \"is_required_parameters_present\": \"true\", //boolean value if all required parameters in the top intent are supplied \"history_context\": { … }, //array of intents and entities from previous intents. \"response\": [ //array of intents and entities from previous intents { \"text\": \"one milk is added to your shopping list at BigGrocery\", \"default_response\": \"\" } ], } \"vrs_name_lookups\": [ { \"vrs_name\": \"biggrocery\" } ], \"channel_location\": { \"lat\": \"\", \"long\": \"\" }, \"channel\": \"app\", \"source_nlp_provider\": \"microsoft\", \"language\": \"en\" } . Previously-developed and broadly-adopted standards that have shaped Automatic Speech Recognition implementations to date include Web Speech API (a JavaScript API to enable web developers to incorporate speech recognition and synthesis into their web pages. It enables developers to use scripting to generate text-to-speech output and to use speech recognition as an input for forms, continuous dictation and control); Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0 (a syntax for representing grammars for use in speech recognition so that developers can specify the words and patterns of words to be listened for by a speech recognizer); Pronunciation Lexicon Specification Version 1.0 (a syntax for specifying pronunciation lexicons to be used by Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis engines in voice browser applications); Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition (SISR) Version 1.0 (the process of Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition and the syntax and semantics of semantic interpretation tags that can be added to speech recognition grammars to compute information to return to an application on the basis of rules and tokens that were matched by the speech recognizer. In particular, it defines the syntax and semantics of the contents of Tags in the Speech Recognition Grammar Specification) and International Phonetic Alphabet (often used to represent the sound of words in lexicons.)_ . Previously-developed and broadly-adopted standards that have shaped Core Natural Language Understanding implementations to date include EMMA: Extensible MultiModal Annotation markup language Version 2.0 (a set of specifications for multimodal systems providing details of an XML markup language for containing and annotating the interpretation of user input and production of system output), JSON Representation of Semantic Information (a JSON format for representing the results of semantic processing), Abstract Meaning Representation (used for semantic representation language. Is a culmination of prior researchers and projects and could become how semantic meaning of utterances is represented in the future); and ARPA N-Gram format (a published format to portably represent language models in N-Gram format.)_ . Dialog Broker . The Dialog Broker provides a list of fulfillable intents. { \"dialog_broker_id\": UUID, \"url\": \"biggrocery.com/dialog_broker\", \"fulfillable_intents\": [ # some object(s) here that defined a fulfillable intent # add to shopping list # browse products # etc ] } . TODO: add more details here . Dialog Manager . Manages the actual context of the conversation. It is responsible for choosing the best action to perform the conversation. { \"response_id\": UUID, \"query_result\": { ... } } . There are several previously-developed and broadly adopted standards which may be of relevance to the Dialog Manager development. OVON research in Q4 2020 suggests the following: Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) 2.1 (designed for creating audio dialogs that feature synthesized speech, digitized audio, recognition of spoken and DTMF key input, recording of spoken input, telephony, and mixed initiative conversations. Its major goal is to bring the advantages of Web-based development and content delivery to interactive voice response applications), and State Chart XML (SCXML) (which provides a generic state-machine based execution environment based on CCXML and Harel State Tables.) . Channel Registry . TODO: add introduction and more details here; add to diagrams and flows above . TODO: clean up this bulleted list; it’s just a placeholder of things to consider for now. | Channel registry should work be implementable on any private network OR be a SaaS service provided by a provider | Each channel can be a part of a channel registry | A channel in a channel registry should be able to be made aware of other channels registered in the channel registry | A channel fetches its configuration from the channel registry | Configuration in the channel registry should specify a standard for mandatory configuration items, optional configuration items, or allow flexibility for user-defined configuration items (ex. kind of like how HTTP headers are) | Optional configuration items: | SST engine to be used by the channel | .

    "title": "Why the Open Voice Network?",
    "content": "The Open Voice Network was founded on these beliefs: . | We are in the early days of voice assistance. We believe the future of voice assistance is “multi” – a world of innumerable enterprise conversational agents operating across multiple platforms, accessed through multiple types of devices, accompanied by multiple modalities, and contextually integrated. Today, the world of voice assistance is dominated by proprietary, cloud-centric platforms (and related devices) that deliver services using closed implementations. While closed systems can create value for stakeholders and selected partners, a lack of standards-based interoperability and governance restricts the growth (and economic value) of a larger voice ecosystem. | A broad lack of user trust inhibits investment and innovation in voice. A significant barrier to the realization of user value in voice assistance is the lack of trust that users (from consumers to patients to enterprise decision-makers) have in current voice processes and providers. | Standards can only emerge from an open, neutral, and communal perspective. Proposed standards will gain the greatest support (and eventual adoption) when such standards are developed through the leadership of an open, neutral, third party – one dedicated to the best for the most. The name “Open Voice Network” speaks to two core operating principles. The first is that OVON is “open” – transparent in its work, and neutral in its interests. The second is that OVON is a network of voice user communities – inclusive of aspirations and concerns from enterprises to voice developers and designers, data analysts and ethicists, marketers and media, and voice platforms worldwide. | Standards create trust and unlock value. The introduction of communally-developed and broadly adopted standards and guidelines is essential to the creation of trust – and in turn, the realization of the technology’s full societal value. | . The Open Voice Network is Voice First . The Open Voice Network is Voice First. We are language-centric, conversationally-focused, and cognizant of the variety and richness of voice data. We are also user-centric, inclusive (believing that voice is for all), and desirous of voice being a tool for societal good. We recognize that voice will be increasingly combined with other digital modalities of communication and conversation, such as screen-based visuals, gestures, and facial recognition. However: to focus our work and drive results, we will solve voice first. From Then to Today: the Rationale for the Open Voice Network . The idea that machines could talk with and listen to humans is far from a 21st century idea. The development of voice-based virtual assistants, often known as voicebots, reaches back at least to the 1960’s. Research into machine-based speech recognition began to bear fruit in the 1950’s. Exploration of speech synthesis – machines that could talk – has been traced all the way back to the late 18th century. Given the lengthy and rich history of machines that can talk and listen – a phenomenon we may today describe as voice assistance – it is vitally important that any entity wishing today to work in this space must study and understand prior research and existing standards. Prior to second decade of this century, voicebots most often served in interactive voice response (IVR) applications for telephony-based services, primarily in enterprise call centers. Numerous technical standards for voice recognition and speech synthesis were developed and broadly adopted during this time. A next era of voice – one defined by consumer-owned and -centered natural-language processing and a cloud-based solution architecture – was heralded by the 2011 launch of Apple’s Siri voice assistant and the 2014 launch of Amazon’s Alexa assistant on the new Echo device. The launch of the Echo also created an entirely new consumer digital device category – the in-home smart speaker. This device type has become the fastest-selling consumer electronics category of all time. Over the years, global annual wholesale shipments of smart speaker devices grew from roughly 9 million units in 2016 to a projected 136.9 million units in 2020 – a 72.36% CAGR. Such success prompted others to join the consumer voice market, and to expand the use of voice assistants into a wide range of enterprise use cases. Voice assistance – now defined largely by its new, user-owned capabilities – now extends well beyond the call center. It is increasingly an interface for machine and vehicle operation, factory management, and enterprise software. At the same time, voice assistance has – following the Apple model – become a standard feature on smartphones. More than 500 million units of Android-enabled smartphones enjoyed voice assistant functionality as of January 2020. Despite this remarkable growth over the past decade in capabilities, availability and adoption, it is largely believed by leading industry analysts that voice assistance is still in its early days. Voice experts suggest that we will soon see: . | Significant advances in voice assistant capabilities. The user experience of voice assistance will be transformed in multiple ways. Of most importance will be the shift from today’s command-and-question interaction to contextually-aware human-to-machine conversation. In practice, this will enable conversation akin to that with a friend, where shared history, time, place, sentiment, and personal preferences are brought seamlessly into the flow of a discussion. A voice assistant will not only understand what is said, but the context in which it is said and the emotion with which it is said – and be able to respond, recommend, and remember. Voice will also be combined with visual elements, to provide what experts term “multi-modal” conversation. This could range from information shown on screens to the recognition of gestures and facial behaviors. | Voice interfaces and conversational agents everywhere. Voice will become ubiquitous – the ever-device, everywhere interface to the digital world. Voice assistance will be integrated not only into devices of all types, but into places (homes, stores, banks, medical facilities, museums, stadiums) and systems for monitoring environments and processes, from factories to farms. Analysts predict active voice assistant use on more than two billion smartphones by 2023¹, and some 8.4 billion voice assistant users worldwide by 2024². Users will search for and speak to websites (more than 1.7 billion worldwide today³), and smart, connected objects (some 41 billion worldwide by 2025⁴.) Futurists see a world in which voice is the normative interface for all artificial intelligence; indeed, it is predicted that all artificial intelligence will be conversational.⁵ . | Market transitions in the AI-enabled voice ecosystem and value chain. A unique industry is now being created by world-leading technology firms through voice assistance. Voice is increasingly the entry point of a data-consuming engine of technology and economic growth. Hundreds of thousands (and in time, millions) of independently-developed and purpose-built enterprise and organizational voice assistants will emerge , each speaking and listening to constituents through a multitude of voice channels. This will reflect an important market transition, as voice shifts from a world bounded by platform-based skills and actions to one akin to today’s internet, with independent sites connecting to users across multiple global platforms. | The emergence of platform-independent voice assistants. This calls into question platform and assistant interoperability, in which an enterprise-owned independent assistant can speak with all others, regardless of platform or channel. It suggests a standardization of components, the building blocks of voice assistants – components that have emerged from many of the standards listed below. | Growing legislative and regulatory interest in voice. Numerous questions, on topics such as privacy, data ownership, data use, and so-called platform economics, are now being raised by western law-makers and regulators. | . In the summer of 2016, a team of academic researchers, consultants, and technology executives came together to explore the implications of this new world of voice. The 2016-2017 research posited that this new world of voice assistance could – and, in time, would – re-shape the relationship between an enterprise and its constituents (be they shoppers, clients, or patients.) It also suggested that this new world of user-centric voice assistance represented a significant market realignment, with voice evolving from a limited-purpose technology to the interface of a new, global system of AI-enabled virtual communication. This team was encouraged in this vision – then, as it is now – by the continued advancements in the technologies and linguistic research that enable voice assistance. However, it was quickly recognized that technology and linguistic innovation alone would not drive voice assistance to broad enterprise acceptance and substantial market growth. At least three other high-level dependencies were identified: . | Enterprise trust in a level playing field: a widely-accepted belief that voice is a technology through which all players could benefit, and that a communally-developed “rule of law” governs the interplay between members of the voice ecosystem. | Confidence in enterprise value creation, capture, and delivery: a widely-accepted belief – one based upon demonstrations and documentation of use cases – that voice assistance can and will provide a significant return on an enterprise investment. | An open technology ecosystem and architecture: the enabler of choice – the ability to select best-of-breed technologies with the confidence of interoperability. | . These dependencies begged (then and now) for broad governing standards. Especially standards (and protocols) that would enable the openness, user choice, inclusivity, and user trust so essential to the system’s growth and value. To a large degree, the state of voice assistance resembled the early, pre-standards “browser war” days of the internet. Vision of the Open Voice Network . To develop and drive adoption of the technical standards and usage guidelines that will make voice assistance worthy of user trust. Voice assistance is in its earliest days. It is rapidly moving toward a global future that will be multi-assistant, multi-platform, multi-device, multi-modal, and found in every industry. It promises significant value not only to voice providers, but to its users – the enterprises, marketers and communicators, operational managers, developers and designers, and billions of individuals worldwide. To realize its potential, conversational AI must be open and worthy of user trust. It must be open for development and innovation. It must be trust-worthy in its ease and reliability use, in its direct and unfiltered access to desired destinations, in its commercial and data usage and privacy, in its cross-platform interoperability, in lack of bias, in its development languages and protocols. Through the centuries, the development and adoption of standards has repeatedly sparked ever-advancing use, innovation, ecosystem development, and economic growth for new technologies. We, the sponsors and supporters of The Open Voice Network, believe that now – at the dawn of conversational AI’s multi-platform future – is the time to communally develop and drive toward adoption the conversational AI standards that will enable user trust. The history of the World Wide Web (WWW) is instructive for the Open Voice Network and the future of voice assistance. In the early days of the World Wide Web, user experience was shackled by closed implementations (e.g., AOL, etc). Thankfully, open standards such as the Domain Name System (DNS) and industry-wide bodies such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) unleashed the potential of the web, and it became the extraordinarily valuable and innovative ecosystem we know today. We believe that voice-enabled devices and services will exponentially expand in use and value when provided a set of open standards. Development and adoption of such standards will prevent users from re-creating basic functionalities, and enable providers, innovators, and enterprises to focus their investments on innovation and usage differentiation. In addition, a voice ecosystem that is open, inclusive, and trust-worthy may also need new governance systems and capabilities, such as: . | a Voice Registry Service (VRS) | Dialog Brokers, Dialog Managers, and other new components | Privacy controls and standard ways to communicate and disclose this to users. | . Furthermore, like the open standards that made the World Wide Web successful, these standards would aim to have these traits: . | Open development from and through a community of regional, language, and gender diversity; | Open management by an open committee with a neutral governing entity | Can have an open-source reference implementation | Can be implemented as open-source and/or closed source products and services | Abstracted at the right level as to not too deeply specify particular technologies used to implement them | . The Guiding Values of the Open Voice Network . Standing before the growth of conversational AI in usage and economic value are four broad issues: . Trust, choice, inclusivity, and openness. Trust opens the door to personal and enterprise adoption, and to ever-more complex usage by all users – from individuals to developers and designers to enterprise decision-makers. The foundation of user trust is a “rule of law” which best emerges from the neutral, industry-driven development of standards and standards-based systems. Such a rule of law includes standards to protect the user’s privacy and security, provide visibility to data and data use, and enable consent processes for data use and sharing; it also asserts standards and guidance for data use (both personal and commercial), inclusivity and accessibility, and system governance. The Open Voice Network’s stated mission is to make voice worthy of user trust. Choice is a catalyst for ecosystem innovation and the growth of value for individuals, developers and designers, and enterprises of all sizes. Choice is realized in many ways – in a user’s ownership and control of data, in a user’s choice of components, assistants and providers, and in the choice of assistant architecture (be it hosted locally or in the cloud.) . Inclusivity is about everyone having a voice, and in every situation. It is voice that welcomes under-represented vocalizations and dialects; voice that advances access for everyone. Openness enables interoperability among assistants and providers. At its core is the identification and definition of standardized development building blocks. Such blocks serve as a foundation for commercial differentiation and value; they can be assembled according to purpose, and in completely open, completely proprietary, or mixed (or hybrid) implementations. OVON’s Ways of Working are Based Upon Our Core Values . | We are neutral and inclusive, welcoming to participation and sponsorship all members of the conversational AI industry – from independent developers and designers to enterprise users to technology firms and platform providers. | We seek broad participation and communal development. No one company or person will set the direction of Open Voice Network proposed standards or usage guidelines. | We work collaboratively with standards bodies and existing industry organizations. | We adhere to an open process: collaborative, communal, balanced development; broad consensus in decision-making; transparency in decisions and documentation. | We seek technological solutions that . | can have an open-source reference implementation | can be implemented through open source and/or proprietary-source products and services | are abstracted at the right level, as to not too deeply specify particular technologies or providers | provide commercial providers and entrepreneurs the room necessary for innovation and differention. | . | . Standards and Usage Guidelines: An Aspirational List . The Technical Advisory Council of The Open Voice Network is responsible for determining OVON’s research and development of technical standards and usage guidelines. It reports to the Open Voice Network Steering Committee. These topics are in exploration: . ",

Example Use Case(s) for Resolution . The Open Voice Network will test its proposed solutions against aspirational enterprise use cases from the vertical industries of the Open Voice Network: commerce (retail and consumer goods), media, transportation, financial services, health and life sciences, public safety, connected cities, and education. Commerce: . The enterprise: a multi-line retailer of goods and services with more than 50 million monthly active customers. The customer base is 65% female, 35% male; speaks seven primary languages, with multiple dialects; and actively uses conversational AI to connect to the retailer through smartphones (40%), automobiles (30%), smart speakers (25%) and smart appliances (5%). Customers of this retailer use voice to establish and manage retailer club membership; place and pay for weekly replenishment orders; place and pay for unique orders; place and pay for prescription drug/pharmacy orders; place and pay for media and streaming services; manage orders and service scheduling-reservations with affiliated service providers; manage access real-time information as to order status and shipment; obtain household value information, ranging from recipes to beverage recommendations to new-born and infant care; obtain use and how-to information from branded product vendors. Customers will transact with this retailer using a wide range of payment options. The retailer considers all data within its customer interactions and transactions to be proprietary. 1.0 Project Definition and Intellectual Property Licensing . Since its incorporation in May 2020, the Open Voice Network Technical Committee has operated within a Linux Foundation-chartered Project entitled PROJECT 1.0: VOCABULARY AND DEFINITION. The stated remit of Project 1.0 is to name, operationally define, and prioritize the potential areas for standards development within the realm of artificial intelligence-enabled voice assistance in a manner that is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE), and for OVON Steering Committee review. The purpose of Project 1.0 is to establish a foundational floor of guidance for Technical Committee organization, talent recruitment, and resourcing. Project 1.0 operates according to a Creative Commons (CC) Attribution 4.0 license. Initial Areas of OVON Standards and Usage Research . Voice Registry System . One of the most important standards that gave rise to the World Wide Web (WWW) is the Domain Name System (DNS), the hierarchial and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. Since its initial implementation in 1985, the DNS has translated readily memorized domain names to the numerical internet protocol addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices. The need for a DNS-like system for voice, one that could connect explicit requests for specific destinations to a third-party conversational agent or voice application, has been part of OVON participant conversations since 2017. Soon after the incorporation of the Open Voice Network in May 2020, a Work Group was formed by the OVON Technical Committee, and tasked with evaluation of “the market/need opportunity for a global, platform-agnostic voice destination registry.” If such an opportunity was found, the Work Group was asked to “identify and define the capabilities of such a registry in preparation for the formation of an OVON Project.” . Introduction to the VRS. Voice Registry System (VRS) is the new concept that is part of the open-voice standards. VRS is a new global entity and, therefore, part of the pre-processing identification in the NLP. Once the NLP identifies @vrs, it passes the information to the VRS server. The job of the VRS is to resolve the query by trying to resolve first in the root server. If not found, it is smart enough to point to the next name server, and this process continues until the request is resolved, or determined that the requested @vrs is not registered. For more information and details about VRS, please go to this document. Voice-Specific Privacy and Security . Concerns regarding the privacy of voice assistant conversations (and the subsequent use of conversational data) has been repeatedly identified by user research and voice industry analysts as a major issue inhibiting voice use at individual and enterprise levels. (See Kinsella; add details here) In early, summer 2020 meetings of the OVON Technical Committee, it was decided to form a Work Group to “identify, defined, and prioritze the capabilities that the OVON must ‘design in’ to its other work in regards to individual privacy and data security.” . In addition to its advisory role to the VRS and Architecture Work Groups, it was also determined in subsequent meetings that a Privacy and Security Work Group could bring benefit to the OVON and the industry at large by developing neutral, platform-agnostic guidelines for the protection of legislated and regulated privacy rights, and the promotion of widely-held privacy values. To meet this broad remit, the OVON Privacy and Security Work Group began its work in Q3 2020 with the study of the critical legislation and regulation that now governs individual privacy, as well as highly-cited third party privacy guidelines and those of leading voice assistant providers. (A list of references follows.) . additional content as of 2021.01.03 to be added here. Component Definition and Interface Interoperability . The interoperability of voice assistance platforms and conversational agents – one with the ease of use of today’s multi-browser internet – is at the heart of the OVON’s vision of an open, accessible voice ecosystem that is worthy of user trust. With this in mind, the OVON Technical Committee formed in the Summer of 2020 an Architecture Work Group, tasked to “identify, define, and prioritize common voice assistant components for potential standardization”. The Architecture Work Group began its efforts by studying the architectures and components of several independent voice assistant concepts, including those of the the W3C Voice Interaction Community and the Stanford Open Voice Assistant Lab (OVAL), seeking to identify and define the common “building block” components of voice assistance.

Each component consumes artifacts from previous components and produces artifacts for use by later components. For example, the TTS component will accept text artifacts as input and produce speech artifacts as output. Each component should have a standard format for its input and output artifacts so a component can be easily replaced or reused. Flexibility . We will define the formats for artifacts (but not the algorithms that convert, consume, and produce artifacts). By standardizing artifact formats, we enable the replacement of components by other components that process input artifacts and product output artifacts faster, more efficiently, or more accurately. For example, a speech recognition component algorithm based on the hidden Markov model can be replaced by a neural network model. Every voice agent contains components that consume and manipulate artifacts. If components in different voice agents produce and consume artifacts in standard formats, artifacts can be shared across voice agents. We will define the formats for input and output artifacts of voice processing components such as ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition which converts speech to text), NLP (used to extract semantics from text produced by ASR), DM (dialog manager which processes the semantics), and TTS (which converts text to spech). Note that we do not specify the algorithms inside each component; technology vendors compete by providing alternative algorithms for components. Voice agent developers can select components from multiple vendors that fill the developers specific needs, and connect the selected components together because they communicate with each other using standardized artifacts. Here are some examples: . | In a smart home environment, it may be desirable to add speech recognition and encoding software to a microphone. (Figure C2) The microphone converts speech to digital text which is then encoded for security purposes before transmission to a network hub for further processing. Because text is more compact than speech, this approach saves transmission bandwidth. TTSs are often designed to perform well with a specific national language (North American English, German, etc.) | Figure C3 illustrates the replacement of an North American English TTS by a German TTS which pronounces German better than the English TTS | In order to accommodate a handicapped person who can not speak or hear well, the microphone and speaker are replaced by a keyboard and display in Figure C4. | . Interoperability . Interoperability enables one voice agent to use the data and functions of another voice agent. For example, a shopping agent collects user account information and then invokes a second agent, the validity agent. Information collected during the shopping agent needs to be copied to the validity agent in order to avoid having the validity agent solicit same information from the user again. In a more detailed example, Figure C5 illustrates the intents for an airline reservation voice agent and a hotel reservation voice agents and the resulting user dialogs. Note that the redundant turns (denoted in colors) in the user dialogs. The redundant turns can be removed from the user dialogs by copying slot values from the airline reservation voice agent to slots within the hotel reservation voice agent. Component Framework . In order to manage the big task of identifying and recommending standard formats for artifacts, we partition components into four baskets inspired by the advent and progress of automotive transportation. High-level descriptions of these four baskets and their possible components follows. (Figure C6) . 1. Macadam Road “Foundational” Component Basket (Core functionality) . Named after the 18th century Scottish engineer who invented the hard-surface, reliable road. This basket of components provides the basic infrastructure needed by voice agents.

    "content": "Vocabulary . See OVON vocabularies. Examples . Several examples that are useful to explain all the concepts required in the design: . “Computer, please add milk to my shopping list at BigGrocery” . | machine translates to → {wakeword}, {query} {vrs} | intent: addShoppingList | entities: milk = @product | . “Computer, ask BigGrocery to add milk to my shopping list” . | translates to → {wakeword}, {vrs} {query} | intent: addShoppingList | entities: milk = @product | . Component Architecture . Note: Dialog Broker, VRS, and Dialog Manager are new concepts. NLP, TTS / STT, and Channels are things that already exist, but we list them because they will be affected and influenced by the standards. Component Flow . This component flow section aims to describe the general steps that happen in and between each component. | “{wake word}, add milk to my shopping list at BigGrocery.” | NLP calls VRS and passes the query. NLP sends in the query its location and what it thinks the VRS name lookup should resolve for (in the case below it understands that “biggrocery” is what the VRS lookup is for). See Figure 1.0. | . { \"query\": \"add milk to my shopping list at biggrocery\", \"vrs_name_lookups\": [ { \"vrs_name\": \"biggrocery\"} ], \"channel_location\": { \"lat\": \"\", \"long\": \"\" }, \"channel\": \"app\", \"source_nlp_provider\": \"AmazonLex\" } . | The name lookup of the “biggrocery” is resolved in VRS. It will respond with the records for the dialog broker, dialog manager, and NLP for the given location(s) that were requested in the lookup. See Figure 2.0 and Figure 2.1. | NLP will call the Dialog Broker based on the endpoint it receives from the VRS. See Figure 3.0 | NLP identifies the intent and entities. If identified intent is not part of the fulfillable intents, NLP will do a default fail response. | . { \"intent\": \"addShoppingList\", \"entities\": [ { \"@product\" } ], \"query\": \"add milk to my list at biggrocery\" } . | If VRS returns the Dialog Manager endpoint, NLP will call the Dialog Manager to have a better dynamic response for the vendor. | . Component Details . This component details section aims to further define the individual components in more detail. Utterance . An utterance construct is: {wake word}, {query} . Wake Word . Wake word options: . | Static wake word | Trainable static wake word | Custom trainable wake word (e.g. instead of “Hey Google”, “Hey Johnny”) | Add another ecosystem’s wake word (Hey Google, Hey Alexa, Hey Siri, etc) to a device in addition to the wake word(s) already on the device (this would result in more than 1 wake word being on the device). This would require a standard given it’s an interface that would need standardization. | . Query . The words that the user is using after the wake word. The query can have multiple constructs. Examples: . | {invocation} | {launch phrase} {explicit invocation} | {launch phrase} {implicit invocation} | . Channel . Channel is the physical or virtual interface to the user where the dialog between the computer and the user occurs (e.g. a physical device, a web page, apps, etc). It is responsible for receiving voice input from a user and delivering back a potentially personalized response using inputs from TTS and the Dialog Manager. It manages the specific native framework such as cards to provide a better user experience and address some visual nuisances to individual channels. STT / TTS . Speech To Text (STT) is the component of the architecture that converts the audio to text. It applies a deep-learning AI algorithm to apply knowledge about noise robustness, phrase hints, spelling, language structure, and global vocabulary of any utterances. Text To Speech (TTS) is the opposite of the STT. It translates a text to a more synthesized natural-sounding speech. The TTS is the component that creates a simulated conversation with the user. Both STT, and TTS can be implemented on the cloud, on-premise, or embedded devices based on what the technology offers. There are multiple known STT / TTS technologies in the industry such as Watson STT, Google Cloud, Microsoft, and Mozilla Deepspeech. This is another domain where OVON can play a significant role in influencing the standard schema for all the STT / TTS technologies players. Previously-developed and broadly-adopted standards that have shaped STT and TTS development include Web Speech API (a JavaScript API that allows web developers to incorporate speech recognition and synthesis into their web pages), Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0 (a standard way to control presentation of speech such as pronunciation, volume, pitch rate, etc. across different synthesis-capable platforms), Proununciation Lexicon Specification Version 1.0 (a syntax for specifiying pronunciation lexicons to be used by Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis engines in voice browser applications), Emotion Markup Language (Emotion ML) 1.0 (a “plug-in” language suiteable for use in three different areas: 1) manual annotation of data, 2) automatic recognition of emotion-related stsates from user behavior; and 3) generation of emotion-related system behavior), anbd ToBI (a set of conventions for transcribing and annotating the prosody of speech.). NLP . As we enter the era of human-machine conversation, the crown jewel component of it is Natural Language Processing. The problem we are facing today is the lack of standards from different NLP providers. In the world of open-standard, we are introducing the concept of a global entity, i.e., @vrsname. It is not about primitive data types that individual NLP understands but a smart object that all NLP providers understand. In the pre-processing stage of NLP, it is evaluating the query as a whole and identifying if any global identity exists in the query. The identified global entity is submitted to the VRS. The global identity solves the interoperability aspect of NLPs. For example, the word “BigGrocery” in Amazon NLP is going to be treated the same way in Microsoft Luis or Einstein. Like domain names, this gives businesses the flexibility to be handled identically in the world of the human-machine conversation regardless of the NLP provider they choose. NLP schema is another place where OVON can influence the standard. Different NLPs have their own set of schema that leads to the different implementation of standards. Some NLPs understand the concept of entity, but some do not. Some understand the intent, and some have different flavors of it and call it “action.” Because of the closed implementations, each business has to orchestrate this separately or build their abstracted implementation version to be able to adapt to different NLP standards. OVON is proposing to set a standard schema for all NLP to follow: . { \"response_id\": UUID, \"query\": \"add one milk to my shopping list at biggrocery\", // raw version of the user inquiry \"query_result\": { \"intents\": [ // list of intents related to the query { \"name\": \"addShoppingList\", \"display_name\": \"add shopping list\", \"confidence_score\": 0.9999, \"is_top_score\": \"true\" }, { \"name\": \"orderList\", \"display_name\":\"order shopping\" \"confidence_score\": 0.7982 \"entities\": [ //list of entities related to the query { \"one\": \"sys.integer\" }, { \"milk\": \"@product\" } ], \"is_required_parameters_present\": \"true\", //boolean value if all required parameters in the top intent are supplied \"history_context\": { … }, //array of intents and entities from previous intents. \"response\": [ //array of intents and entities from previous intents { \"text\": \"one milk is added to your shopping list at BigGrocery\", \"default_response\": \"\" } ], } \"vrs_name_lookups\": [ { \"vrs_name\": \"biggrocery\" } ], \"channel_location\": { \"lat\": \"\", \"long\": \"\" }, \"channel\": \"app\", \"source_nlp_provider\": \"microsoft\", \"language\": \"en\" } . Previously-developed and broadly-adopted standards that have shaped Automatic Speech Recognition implementations to date include Web Speech API (a JavaScript API to enable web developers to incorporate speech recognition and synthesis into their web pages. It enables developers to use scripting to generate text-to-speech output and to use speech recognition as an input for forms, continuous dictation and control); Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0 (a syntax for representing grammars for use in speech recognition so that developers can specify the words and patterns of words to be listened for by a speech recognizer); Pronunciation Lexicon Specification Version 1.0 (a syntax for specifying pronunciation lexicons to be used by Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis engines in voice browser applications); Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition (SISR) Version 1.0 (the process of Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition and the syntax and semantics of semantic interpretation tags that can be added to speech recognition grammars to compute information to return to an application on the basis of rules and tokens that were matched by the speech recognizer. In particular, it defines the syntax and semantics of the contents of Tags in the Speech Recognition Grammar Specification) and International Phonetic Alphabet (often used to represent the sound of words in lexicons.)_ . Previously-developed and broadly-adopted standards that have shaped Core Natural Language Understanding implementations to date include EMMA: Extensible MultiModal Annotation markup language Version 2.0 (a set of specifications for multimodal systems providing details of an XML markup language for containing and annotating the interpretation of user input and production of system output), JSON Representation of Semantic Information (a JSON format for representing the results of semantic processing), Abstract Meaning Representation (used for semantic representation language. Is a culmination of prior researchers and projects and could become how semantic meaning of utterances is represented in the future); and ARPA N-Gram format (a published format to portably represent language models in N-Gram format.)_ . Dialog Broker . The Dialog Broker provides a list of fulfillable intents. { \"dialog_broker_id\": UUID, \"url\": \"biggrocery.com/dialog_broker\", \"fulfillable_intents\": [ # some object(s) here that defined a fulfillable intent # add to shopping list # browse products # etc ] } . TODO: add more details here . Dialog Manager . Manages the actual context of the conversation. It is responsible for choosing the best action to perform the conversation. { \"response_id\": UUID, \"query_result\": { ... } } . There are several previously-developed and broadly adopted standards which may be of relevance to the Dialog Manager development. OVON research in Q4 2020 suggests the following: Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) 2.1 (designed for creating audio dialogs that feature synthesized speech, digitized audio, recognition of spoken and DTMF key input, recording of spoken input, telephony, and mixed initiative conversations. Its major goal is to bring the advantages of Web-based development and content delivery to interactive voice response applications), and State Chart XML (SCXML) (which provides a generic state-machine based execution environment based on CCXML and Harel State Tables.) . Channel Registry . TODO: add introduction and more details here; add to diagrams and flows above . TODO: clean up this bulleted list; it’s just a placeholder of things to consider for now. | Channel registry should work be implementable on any private network OR be a SaaS service provided by a provider | Each channel can be a part of a channel registry | A channel in a channel registry should be able to be made aware of other channels registered in the channel registry | A channel fetches its configuration from the channel registry | Configuration in the channel registry should specify a standard for mandatory configuration items, optional configuration items, or allow flexibility for user-defined configuration items (ex. kind of like how HTTP headers are) | Optional configuration items: | SST engine to be used by the channel | .

Examples include smart devices, mobile phones, web sites, mobile app, etc. See Conversational Endpoint, below. | Combo-Component - a component that performs the functions normally associated with two or more components. An example could be a component with functions of both automatic speech recognition and natural language processing that accepts audio input and produces a semantic structure as an output. | Component Interoperability - the ability, within a voice assistant, to replace one component with another from a different vendor. For the purposes of the Open Voice Network, interoperable components may be recognized within the voice industry as open or proprietary as long as interoperability capabilities are met. | Context - see “Conversational Context,” below. Information extracted from n prior utterances of the current conversation. This could include some or all of the following: information that has been input, output, or inferred in Conversational Processors, and the information state of the Dialog Manager. | Conversation - a joint activity in which two or more agents (human or automated) use linguistic forms and non-verbal signals (i.e., gestures) to communicate to achieve an outcome that meets a shared goal. | Conversation Event - A conversation event signals changes in the conversational that may be acted upon. Such an event may be at the beginning or ending of a Conversational Session, completion of a Conversation Processor, decoding of Conversation Information, changes to the state of a Conversation Endpoint, or changes to the status of a Conversation Stream. Any component with access to the system is allowed to generate a Conversation Event. | Conversation Facilitator - coordinates communication between two or more Dialogue Systems and/or Processors during the course of one or more Sessions. This allows dialogue Systems and associated Processors to collaborate regardless of technology being used. Examples of Conversation Information include semantic, lexical, syntactic, and prosodic features. | Conversation Information Layer - represents an abstraction of a type of information in a Dialog System. A layer may be a specific type of acoustic, linguistic, non-linguistic, or paralinguistic features. Examples of layers would be Cepstral features, Phonemes, Intonation Boundaries, Words, Phrases, Turn Boundaries, Syllabic Stress, Discourse Move Tiype, and specific Semantic representation schemes. | Conversation Processors - Conversation information is encoded and/or decoded by one or more Conversational Processors, also known as a Component. Conversational Processors may also take as input the output from another Conversation Processor. A Conversation Processor may generate Conversation Events and Conversation Streams. | Conversation Session - A particular conversation that consists of two or more Conversation Streams (see below) generated by two or more agents through one or more Conversational Endpoints. Sessions may be persistent, but they will often have a start-point and an end-point in time determined by one of the Agents or some other external event. | Conversation Stream - Each Conversational Endpoint generates one or more Conversation Streams based upon the capabilities of the Endpoint and the preferences of the Agent. A Conversation Stream is associated with a particular Agent and may include any media type including text, audio, video, and application UI events. | Conversational Agent - A digital participant in a conversation. This may be an application with a consistent persona, such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, the Target Google Assistant Action, a Facebook Messenger chatbot, or an IVR system at a bank. Conversational agent is a common term utilized in the area of Dialogue System research and university level instruction; the term often is used to describe a human participant in a conversation. For clarity of reference, however, the OVN will use the term “user” to identify a human participant. (See “user” below.) | Conversational AI - is the set of technologies to enable automated communication between computers and humans. This communication can be speech and text. Conversational AI recognizes speech and text, understands intent, decipher various languages, and responds where it mimics human conversation. In some cases, it is also known as Natural Language Processing. | Conversational Context - more research is required and underway; however, as of 2020.12.15, the Open Voice Network will use this definition: information extracted from N prior utterances of the current conversation. This could include some or all of the following: information that has been input, output, or inferred in Conversational Processors, and the information state of the Dialog Manager. | Conversational Endpoint - agents conduct conversations using conversational endpoints; these may be a phone, mobile device, voice speaker, personal computer, kiosk, or any other device that enables an agent to participate in a conversation. Endpoints may be referred to elsewhere as a “device” or a “channel.” | Conversational Information Packets - information that relates to a specific period of time. Packets form the input and output of Conversation. | Conversational Platform - A group of technologies that are used as a base for one or more conversational agents; also (see “Platform” below) a business model that harnesses and creates a large, scalable network of users and resources that can be accessed on demand. | .
