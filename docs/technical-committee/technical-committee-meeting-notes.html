Regarding pricing: we will ask for Statements of Work from final candidates. In some cases, the expertise we desire may be more expensive than the monies budgeted. Our response will be determined by the expertise of the applicant; however, we may choose to limit deliverables (or phase the work into 2022) to stay within budget. Per a question from O. Coleman: a) we may engage either with individuals or with the entities with which a candidate is affiliated or employed; b) we will use for agreement the standard Linux Foundation consultant agreement. Copies of the latter can be obtained from N. Caidin or J. Stine.</li> <li>Community Specifications licenses now in place for OVON Interoperability and VRS Work, per J. Stine. Four actions required: <ul> <li>S. Nicholas of the LF to review, approve establishment of Community Specifications licenses, as now in GitHub</li> <li>N. Caidin, J.

Larson unable to attend today. • European Data Protection Board (EDPB) released “1.0 Guidelines for Virtual Voice Assistants.” General observations: applies GDPR to virtual voice assistance; is now the benchmark for the voice industry; current OVN privacy ork aligns nicely with the EDPB guidelines. o Other observations: EDPB guidelines focus on current state of the major platform duopology; does not anticipate the hybrid ecosystem of the independent enterprise virtual assistant; does not address a non-cloud architecture; does not address the future of interoperability – the sharing of dialogues; does not address issues related to voice data analysis, including biomarkers or other advanced voice data analysis.</p> <h3 id="work-group-progress-toward-quarterly-milestones"> <a href="#work-group-progress-toward-quarterly-milestones" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="work-group-progress-toward-quarterly-milestones"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Work Group Progress Toward Quarterly Milestones </h3> <p>J. Stine reminded Work Groups in re: Q1 Deliverables (two weeks remaining) and Q2 Deliverables, to be defined by March 31, 2021. Also: an expectation that existing and in-work documents will be reconciled to the official OVN vocabulary by end of April 30, 2021</p> <h3 id="q1-milestone-deliverables--updates"> <a href="#q1-milestone-deliverables--updates" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="q1-milestone-deliverables--updates"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Q1 Milestone Deliverables / Updates </h3> <p>VRS • Green – publish schema 1.0 • Green – agile practices • Green – job descriptions Two independent development companies have raised their hands to help build out the VRS MVP.</p> <p>Architecture • Blue – Deliver extensible foolproof strategy for sharing components by EOQ1.<br /> Architecture Work Group reported a pivot in strategy; from a standardization of components to research/study into what is required to share dialogues (and context, control, and privacy-security) between conversational agents. A five-step process documented, described for moving forward.</p> <p>Privacy &amp; Security Privacy • EDPB: review underway by the team. • Privacy Guidelines 1.0 – publishing the pull request to address items discussed in the Technical Committee “deep dive”. Will be incorporated this weekend.<br /> o Add legal disclaimer to document o More language for “opt in” by default o Mike will take first pass at the vocabulary also with this pull request • “Friends and families” – NRF, FMI, Ecommerce Europe, AVIOS conference, OVN Ethical Use are suggested candidates to review the document.</p> <p>Security • Threat Modelling exercise should be wrapped by end of April. • Doug: Threat Modelling output should be leveraged by the development teams of the VRS MVP implementation work. Maria: work slated for July. • Incorporate the scenarios from the Architecture group as the next round of threat modelling exercise.</p> <p>Privacy Policies Comparison, Analysis • Green: Q1 work on track. • Research work completed by end of March. • Plan to have the summary for Tuesday’s Privacy &amp; Security workgroup meeting.<br /> • Will be prepared to give a high-level overview of the summary in the next Technical Committee meeting.</p> <p>VRS Deep Dive • M. Brinas-Dobrowski provided a detailed overview of VRS process and decisions to date. Discussed at length the options and decision-making in re: the role of NLU in VRS identification and routing; noted clear preference to pursue simplicity – VRS to have a singular function. Also reviewed initial data schema for VRS registration/recognition. S. Prayaga noted need to determine, document registration processes; agreement that such work was still TBD.<br /> D. Rogers povided this guidance on semantic versioning: https://semver.org/ J. Stine noted interest from China Netcasting Services Association (CNSA) to engage, potentially adopt a VRS system from OVN.</p> <h3 id="newsnotes"> <a href="#newsnotes" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="newsnotes"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> News/Notes: </h3> <p>• D.

Stine </h3> <p>J. Stine presented and spoke to an overview of the next steps that Work Groups may take. Three key take-ways: 1) Work Groups will be asked to meet at least one more time to determine next steps. 2) Next steps could include a proposal to the Tech Comm (and then, potentially, the Steering Committee), or additional development work. 3) The determining question of the Technical Committee (and the Steering Committee) will be this: is this worthy of (and ready for) investment of time/personnel/monies en route to standardization?</p> <h3 id="report-from-the-architecture-work-group--j-larson"> <a href="#report-from-the-architecture-work-group--j-larson" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="report-from-the-architecture-work-group--j-larson"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Report from the Architecture Work Group: – J. Larson </h3> <p>J. Larson presented a summation of the work to date of the Architecture Work Group.</p> <ul> <li>An important market transition is driving the need for this review: current and anticipated growth of independent voice assistance.</li> <li>Problems to be resolved: development complexity, inconsistent terminology, reusability of components, extensibility, and interoperability of assistants.</li> <li>Ecosystem and business benefits of resolution: speed, accelerate the creation of new and innovative speech applications; enable enterprises to build once and use many; create a standards-based foundation for commercial innovation, differentiation.</li> <li>Architecture Work Group remit: identify, define, and prioritize common voice assistant components for potential standardization.</li> <li>A 1.0 definition of a reusable component was presented: defined by input and output, defined as a collection of related functionalities, defined as flexible, and able to be used in many configurations, defined as a building block for applications-assistant creation.</li> <li>A generic template of a reusable component was shown.</li> <li>In reaching this point, the Architecture Work Group (AWG) had reviewed a sampling of assistant architectures, and components within. Those reviewed included that shown in the OVN Master Plan, and from the W3C Voice Interaction Community, David Attwater and Jonathan Eisenzopf, and from Dr. Monica Lam of the Stanford OVAL project. The AWG had also discussed potential new components (per Voice Registry System conversations).</li> <li>The Architecture Work Group presented its 1.0 roadmap for component assessment and standardization. For a detailed review, please see https://github.com/open-voice-network/docs/blob/master/Architecture%20Work%20Group%20Working%20Draft%202020.11.18.md.</li> <li>The AWG proposed two new components: A “voice agent finder” for an anticipated Voice Registry System, and for purposes of user-managed rivacy and consent, an Access-Consent Control Guard, as inspired by the Stanford OVAL Almond architecture.</li> <li>The AWG noted four major outstanding questions: 1) the component(s) that should resolve VRS-centric search; 2) how components may be made (or defined in a way to be) future proof; 3) how to proceed forward with minimal viable components (such as ASR, NLU, TTS, Dialog Manager); and 4) the choice of the next component to refine.</li> <li>Going forward, the AWG suggested five next steps: 1) establishment of a 1.0 definition criteria, with an emphasis upon future-proofing; 2) integration of AWG work with that of the Privacy and Security and VRS Work Groups; 3) selection of first components for detailed definition; 4) initiation of outside review, and development of artefacts worthy of a RFC; 5) initiation of Q1 2021 planning for prototype-MVP testing.</li> </ul> <h3 id="report-from-the-vrs-work-group---mbrinas-dobrowski"> <a href="#report-from-the-vrs-work-group---mbrinas-dobrowski" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="report-from-the-vrs-work-group---mbrinas-dobrowski"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Report from the VRS Work Group – M.Brinas-Dobrowski </h3> <ul> <li>Goal – To make a decision if there is a market need/opportunity for a global platform voice registry</li> <li>Terminologies</li> <li>Problem <ul> <li>Setup Mode</li> <li>Runtime Mode</li> <li>No consistent experience</li> <li>Lack of standards</li> <li>No interoperability</li> <li>No consistency or transparency on disambiguation</li> </ul> </li> <li>Recommendations <ul> <li>Advocate to stand up a neutral and single decentralized registry for voice application –the Voice Registry System</li> </ul> </li> <li>Architecture <ul> <li>Arch guiding principles <ul> <li>Single repository</li> <li>Loose coupling</li> <li>Event driven</li> <li>Availability and partitioning eventual consistency</li> <li>Interface segregation</li> <li>Automation (CICD, etc.)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Roles &amp; Responsibilities <ul> <li>Be neutral and single decentralized registry for voice application</li> <li>Create voice application standards to provide a consistent experience</li> <li>VRS is NOT responsible for the interpreting of the intent of the user</li> <li>VRS can hold various attributes regarding the voice applications, such as name, alternative names, category, geolocation</li> <li>VRS can receive inputs like the channels current location but is NOT responsible for storing its preference</li> <li>VRS names can have synergies</li> </ul> </li> <li>Summation: <ul> <li>Please review and add comments in git</li> <li>Next Steps: Each work group decide how this impacts their work</li> </ul> </li> <li>Discussion: <ul> <li>Disambiguation is at domain level</li> <li>The Disambiguation problem will need to be broken down into multiple sub-problems</li> <li>If VRS not responsible for interpreting intent, how will it get to the destination? -Additional discussions in the Architecture Group</li> <li>Should we add the support of different languages?

Larson spoke to the recent discussions within the OVN Developer Community regarding the value of, and potential capabilities of, a Voice Registry System – referred to as a “DNS for Voice” in prior OVN conversations. J. Larson proposed on behalf of the Developer Community that a VRS Work Group be formed, and tasked with initiating the process of defining the current problem and the capabilities of an aspirational future state.</li> <li>M. Brinas-Dobrowski shared an initial overview of the VRS problem statement and potential solution archtecture, now available for review in the OVN docs repository on GitHub.</li> <li>Discussion of the overview and steps to move a VRS Work Group forward. Recommended actions: 1) Work Group (and Technical Committee member) documentation of a) the problems to solve, and b) scenarios-stories that describe the use (and value) of a VRS. This to be brought to a new VRS Slack channel. 2) the reading and review of the M. Brinas-Dobrowski VRS overview now in the Masterplan, and found here: https://github.com/open-voice-network/docs/blob/master/components/voice_registry_system.md. 3) The recruitment of members and leadership for the VRS Work Group, and the scheduling of the first VRS Work Group meeting.</li> </ul> <h3 id="report-update-from-the-architecture-work-group-of-the-technical-committee--john-iwasz-and-jim-larson"> <a href="#report-update-from-the-architecture-work-group-of-the-technical-committee--john-iwasz-and-jim-larson" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="report-update-from-the-architecture-work-group-of-the-technical-committee--john-iwasz-and-jim-larson"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Report, Update from the Architecture Work Group of the Technical Committee – John Iwasz and Jim Larson. </h3> <ul> <li>J. Larson, J. Iwasz reviewed for the Committee their proposal for a “component” approach to the question of an OVN reference architecture. Noted the value of a “Lego block” concept. Proposed to the group an operative definition of “components” and “harnesses” – the latter a collection of existing components that can be used to 1) demonstrate new components, 2) test and evaluate new components, and 3) prototype new voice applications. J. Iwasz noted that the Work Group will be reviewing proposed architectures from D. Attwater and J. Eisenzopf (next meeting), the W3C Voice Interaction Community (D. Schnelle-Walka and D.

Brinas-Dobrowski </h3> <p>It was agreed through discussion that although it would be useful to provide a “primer” overview of the Technical MasterPlan in the meeting, a 90-to-120-minute deep dive would be required and should be scheduled as a primary agenda item for the Technical Community. To that end, M. Brinas-Dobrowski provided a section-by-section overview of the MasterPlan in its current state, highlighting key points along the way. Significant discussion in re: concepts and potential complexity of a DNS, and approaches to architecture. A. Dalloul noted several options for the management of multiple end points; spoke to the challenges of an assumed “multi-home” environment, citing numerous examples (browers, mobile platforms) and extensive Microsoft research. A. Dalloul, D. Attwater, J-C Junqua spoke to the importance of use cases against which concepts can be tested. D. Attwater suggested that the architecture discussion may wish to step backwards, and consider data models and within that, the different entities (devices, enterprises, products, persons) to which a user may wish to connect. Question: what is a Dispatch Registry to do? Connect to some or all entities?</p> <h3 id="next-steps-summation--j-stine"> <a href="#next-steps-summation--j-stine" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="next-steps-summation--j-stine"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Next-steps summation – J.

If they do not, then should be brought back to the Tech Comm meeting for discussion on priority and updates to the Master Plan accordingly</li> <li>Some of the items in the current activity list do not tie back to the Master Plan Discussion:</li> <li>A.Dalloul –timelines and priorities would be helpful so supportive of the discussion</li> <li>S. Baul –regular review of the Master Plan document would be helpful for new joiners and to foster continued alignment. Team agreed that this would be helpful and will ensure happens. <strong>ACTION:</strong> Setup review and on-boarding sessions as to the Master Plan, Activities List – Jon &amp; Dan</li> <li>Dan walked through the docs repo in Git <ul> <li>Technical Master Plan –North star, charter doc in markdown.

Bentsen –roadmap document will help to define interdependencies between working groups that would be helpful</li> <li>A. Dalloul – Some of the areas are horizontal in nature and others are specific and some regulated. As we think about the intersection of these, it will be important to have a level of prioritization as we cannot go after everything while the Master Plan is being further developed. Perhaps a matrix for priorities and sequencing will be helpful</li> <li>J.Larson – at the next developer community group meeting, they will be adding additional activities and will take a run at prioritization via a voting process. Then the priority list can be vetted against the Master Plan document. This can be brought back to the next Technical Committee meeting (6/26/20).</li> <li>J.Stine – also can factor in whether an activity is horizontal or vertical as input to the priority</li> <li>D.Cundiff - We can prioritize and sequence the work an do it in that order. Or we can allow additional, more periphery activities to be completed and submitted to the OVN</li> <li>J.Larson - recommended that 2 classes of activities be identified –foundational and exploratory/community driven/pioneering. Emphasis needs to be on foundational but exploratory/community/pioneering driven will help attract new members, provide new ideas and allow to address fast changing space</li> <li>General discussion was supportive of the 2 class method of foundational and exploratory with the emphasis on foundational. <strong>ACTION:</strong> Dan, Jon and Jim Larson to ID the activities as foundational or exploratory</li> </ul> <h4 id="forming--running-of-the-working-groups"> <a href="#forming--running-of-the-working-groups" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="forming--running-of-the-working-groups"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Forming &amp; Running of the working groups: </h4> <ul> <li>Working group is a collection of people working on a activity or activities</li> <li>Working groups can come and go and some are permanent pending the activity that they are assigned (ex.

Roles &amp; responsibilities and general operating agreement</li> <li>Maarten Lens-FitzGerald, Samrat Baul and Jon Stine volunteered to create a proposal. Jon will include non-regulatory requirements like anti-trust, notes and recording (for audit trail). <strong>ACTION:</strong> Maarten, Samrat and Jon create proposal</li> </ul> <p>Discussion on the Master Plan and missing components. Team reiterated that PRs should be done against the Master Plan for this. Discussed that PRs are new to some.

Lens-Fitzgerald and J. Larsen drafted a list of potential “activities” for Tech Comm consideration. The full list is still being developed. Suggest we use the term Activity vs Project to avoid confusion. Discussion was supportive of using the term Activity. <br /> VOCABULARY DECISION: These will be termed “activities” ACTION: J. Stine to add this to “Ways of Working.” List of suggested activities: 1 Destination Registry 1.1 Name Approaches for Voice Registry - Need to determine the best approach for developing a voice registry <br /> Discussion: This will be similar but not identical to DNS. D. Cundiff shared a few examples like operating aspects. Also do not be too confined to DNS and be sure to be forward looking. Registry aspects of VRS will need to be assessed too –may need separate firms to manage the voice registry. Collaborate with firms like Google &amp; Amazon (users of VRS). Expand the scope of this item to include a baseline of first level requirements vs Analysis. <br /> 2 Voice Commerce Core Processes 2.1 Pay by voice - Accelerating people’s purchasing process through voice payment, voice print and biometrics Discussion: Not a standard but a reference implementation and guidelines that firms can follow to provide the user with a more common experience. The soon to be stood-up voice designer community can help with this. Should this type of experience work come after foundational standards – this work may provide insights into how the lower level standards need to work. This work may also be applicable for other UI applications. Would be good to solicit involvement from bill-pay firms (ex. Capital-One)</p> </li> </ul> <p>3 Identification and Authentication</p> <p>Discussion: Biometrics included here?</p> <p>4 Data Privacy 4.1 Name Evaluate OVAL (Open Virtual Assistant Lab, Stanford University) Approach to Privacy – Need to specify a data privacy policy and enforcement mechanism</p> <p>Discussion: Discussion supportive and promotes reuse. Will need to be in line with GDPR and CCPA. Perhaps combined with Identification and Authentication. Need to assess liability and regulatory impacts.</p> <p>5 Interoperability Discussion: Should we add to interoperability a set of interfaces to interop between applications.</p> <p>5.1 Vendor Independent language for writing speech applications</p> <p>Discussion: This isn’t necessarily a new programming language but rather a vendor independent API specification. Like Jovo –a framework. Could be an open source toolkit. Voice assistant, IVRs or on-device apps. Will need to get Amazon and Google on board here (VII). Will need to put boundaries on the focus of this like channel, NLP, etc. This may not be an essential building block item.</p> <h3 id="meeting-feedback"> <a href="#meeting-feedback" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="meeting-feedback"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Meeting feedback </h3> <ul> <li>Didn’t get through all agenda items</li> <li>Need someone to monitor chat and share out</li> <li>Good discussion today –got into some requirement and maybe use this meeting to do higher level inputs</li> <li>Perhaps a stacked or forced ranked process may be helpful to prioritize efforts</li> <li>organic nature feels ok now</li> <li>Helpful to have a location for sharing existing knowledge/articles/links.

Maas, A. Lee, N. Sharif, L. Lin, S. Nicholas (Linux Foundation), K. Dank, J. Stine.</p> <p>The meeting was brought to order at 08:31 CDT (US).</p> <p>J. Stine announced that the meeting would be managed in accord with the antitrust guidelines of The Linux Foundation, (https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy/), and that the meeting would be recorded (mp3 file found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J_XGKcVnHqyVdWiV9wYjwh8rO8HMCJ3t).</p> <p>1 Linux Foundation Definition of “Project”</p> <p>S. Nicholas of The Linux Foundation reviewed the LF concept of Technical Charter, and the specific “Vocabulary and Definitions” charter now before the OVN Technical Committee. He noted that the OVN has the ability to define and launch additional projects as needs arise. There are three (3) primary reasons why a new project may be needed: Different mission/scope IP framework needs to be different Overall constituency of developers needs to be different.</p> <p>The OVN may need an additional project when the OVN identifies a standard that needs to be developed; at that point, discussion as to the need or a separate project is appropriate.</p> <p>LF process for project definition/determination described by S. Nicholas as “light;” OVN urged not to let concerns about LF processes be a burden or slow things down.</p> <p>Additional questions should be addressed to S. Nicholas or J. Stine.</p> <p>2 Update on OVN Communities and their Role</p> <p>J. Stine described the creation, growth of OVN Communities – comprised of the voice developer-designer-strategist ecosystem, and now in overlapping Slack Channels: Developers, Designer-Strategists, Europe, Health &amp; Life Sciences, and Ethical Use.</p> <p>Each community headed by volunteer moderators; Developer Community moderated by Tech Comm participants J. Larson, J. Herndon, M. Lens-Fitzgerald.</p> <p>Those wishing to participate in the Communities should forward a request to J. Stine.</p> <p>3 OVN Technical Committee Ways of Working</p> <p>D. Cundiff led a discussion of the tools and processes to be used by the OVN Technical Committee. There are 3 primary tools: Gsuite: the current repository for meeting minutes and participant roster. Let J. Stine know your Gmail email address to get added. Slack: the current real-time messaging and document sharing tool. With the exception of calendar/meeting notices, we will seek to migrate away from the use of e-mail. Let J. Stine know your email address to get added to Slack. Github: the working document repository – where we do our work.</p> <p>Let J. Stine know your github.com user name or share it in the Technical Committee slack channel OVN has a variety of repos. A few are currently marked as private but want to convert to open and goal to do this after we ratify the Master Plan document D. Cundiff demonstrated the use, processes within GitHub. ’d the process in Git S. Baul noted he has Git access but hasn’t tried any of the PRs. He is assuming this is OK and confirmed ok</p> <p>A discussion of Tech Comm process, ways of working: J. Larson spoke to the process for “opened up” issues within GitHub related to the Master Plan. These are tracked outside of the document itself and not a PR for the doc. Per D. Cundiff: Participants can use the PR process to start a discussion about potential changes to a document vs opening an issue. Participants can use an issue for dialog on something that is not quite firm or you have questions Action: need to formalize the process for issue management/discussion. Likely part of the Tech Comm meetings going forward. Will also need a process re: prioritization of issues.J. Stine to add this to the “How we work” document now in development. Action: should GitHub training be desired, please let J. Stine know, he will setup a session.</p> <p>4 Review of the Technical Masterplan</p> <p>D. Cundiff discussed the need, timing of another round of reviews to the Technical Masterplan, as found in GitHub. Per D. Cundiff: We want to get the Masterplan to a good, complete V1 –a released state. Action: before the next Tech Comm meeting in 2 weeks, participants are to review the document, create PRs, add comments, and be prepared to ratify.</p> <p>Question from J. Larson: should the Developer community review the vocabulary together to land on PRs/recommendations. Yes, confirmed; this was agreed to as a good approach. Question raised by D. Cundiff, M. Brinas-Dobrowski regarding Master Plan visibility: private v public – aligned to keeping private for 2 months. Comments: M. Frazzini – 2 months; J. Iwasz – 2 months of time to get this more complete would be good before repo goes public; M. Buck – supports 2 month timeframe; M. Lens-Fitzgerald – there is an opportunity for marketing OVN in general with this document. Would be good if we announced that with an artifact that is public; S. Baul - reserve opinion at this point; J, Maas –agree with timeline and transparency with going public will help with momentum; J. Crabb – 2 months to allow for 1st Steering committee meeting.</p> <p>Initial Discussion: Top Three Projects / Working Groups</p> <p>D. Cundiff, J. Stine introduced topic of top three projects. D. Cundiff reminded participants that the Technical Master Plan is the highest level of what we’ll need to work on. Action: Please put ideas in Technical Committee slack channel before next meeting on 5/29. Ideas, Comments:</p> <p>J. Larson: Specify a voice application in a vendor-independent manner that can be transformed to both a working Alexa or Google voice application. Recommend if we should develop a vendor-independent language for writing speech applications that can be translated to be executed on both Alexa and Google platforms.</p> <p>Evaluate Almond as a possible voice-assistant platform. Identify structures and processes useful in our work. Reference: ALMOND, THE OPEN, PRIVACY-PRESERVING VIRTUAL ASSISTANT https://oval.cs.stanford.edu/ Dan responds: This is viable. I really like the interoperability theme. I think that’s future looking. Is Stanford asking you to do this as part of prod management planning? Specify the vocabulary for a frequently-used business activity by constructing and deploying a skill (printing a portion of a conversation) An example approach is outlined in Telephone Commands in five languages, Final draft ETSI ES 202 076 V2.1.1 (2009-06) ETSI Standard Human Factors (HF); User Interfaces; Generic spoken command vocabulary for ICT devices and services https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_es/202000_202099/202076/02.01.01_50/es_202076v020101m.pdf</p> <p>P. Bentsen: [Enhanced/Augmented Audio (Audio Input/Voice Analysis): Specify audio solution requirements (HW, DSP, ASR/STT, AI, VRS, Wake Word, DB, etc.) to a level allowing for remote sensing, voice analysis and user/patient diagnostics, as well as interoperability and interfacing with relevant entities via VRS. This would obviously require CLEAR privacy controls/deterministic privacy and a heavy focus on privacy and data protection, cybersecurity and information security (Amongst use cases, are for H&amp;LS Digital Health, Telemedicine/Remote Patient Monitoring and Public Safety support, potentially other verticals).[Privacy &amp; Data Protection]</p> <p>Privacy &amp; Data Protection (+Deterministic Privacy): Specify Privacy &amp; Data Protection requirements/baselines. Privacy and Data Protection should be foundational and pervasive in all parallel OVN efforts towards standardization and will likely become a regulatory requirement and enforced in the intermediate term for this space as well (GDPR, HIPAA/HITECH/HITRUST, etc). Cybersecurity: Specify Cybersecurity and information security requirements/baselines. Cybersecurity and information security should be foundational and pervasive in the OVN efforts towards standardization (Security Architecture &amp; Engineering, Communication &amp; Network Security, Identity &amp; Access Management, Asset/SW Security).</p> <p>M. Saul: Focus on Voice Registry System ; +1 Nicholas Myers</p> <p>M. Lens-FitzGerald: Not sure that VNS is the biggest priority –wants to know why we think this needs to happen; Holistic view on voice (what is lacking in the technical plan); - Alexa VS talking lights switches (command and control VS conversational services); - Trans modal; - International views and applications, ie China, India, Europe</p> <ul> <li>Other stakeholder ie governments, defense, enterprise; Local language/nlu/data sets; Synthetic voice ; Data /profile manipulation; Inclusion are just preferences; Suggested that Maarten open up issues for some of these.</li> </ul> <p>M. Frazzini: Privacy &amp; Security, Interoperability, Voice Registry System</p> <p>J. Iwasz: Working committees should be defined as horizontal or vertical; Will be helpful to create working groups by industry; IVR systems.</p> <p>M. Buck: Wake words standards.</p> <p>N. Myers: Voice Registry System; Data privacy and Security; Voice “handbook” for the industry; Research on desired use of voice technology versus how it is being used today.</p> <p>S. Baul: Voice Registry Service –wants to be sure that the “why” we are going this is strong as will be a lot of work and want to be sure that it will be used; Truth in what we are doing – how do we ensure that there is truth in adopting the standards. What is the case for standards compliance? Firms need to be motivated to adopt. Standard in measurement of voice quality.</p> <p>J. Maas: Will contribute via Slack.</p> <p>Process question- should we move these working group ideas from Slack to the MasterPlan? Action: if you find items missing from the Masterplan, then do a PR. Please continue to post these in Slack</p> <p>Question: A. Lee–is the OVN focused on a voice assistant, or does the scope extend to IVR’s, more operational use cases?</p> <p>6 Meeting Feedback: Regarding applause, criticism, and recommendations going forward: please place comments in Technical committee slack channel or relay directly to Dan via Slack if preferred.</p> <p>Meeting adjourned at 10:01 a.m. Central Daylight Time.</p> <p>notes by Dank/Stine</p> <h1 id="2020-04-17-notes-of-the-technical-committee-meeting"> <a href="#2020-04-17-notes-of-the-technical-committee-meeting" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="2020-04-17-notes-of-the-technical-committee-meeting"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 2020-04-17 Notes of the Technical Committee Meeting: </h1> <ul> <li>In attendance: D. Cundiff, Chair; C. Wuttke; M. Brinas-Dobrowski. B. Czechowicz; J. Larson; J. Herndon; J. Iwasz; L. Lin; M. Lens-FitzGerald; M. Buck; M. Frazzini; M. Saul; N. Myers; N. Sharif; P. Bentsen; S. Baul; S. Root; S. Prayaga; T. McElreath; V. Tai; K. Dank; J. Stine.</li> </ul> <p>Meeting commenced at 15:30 CET, 08:30 Central Daylight (US).</p> <p>WELCOME. J. Stine opened the meeting, welcomed Tech Com newcomers.</p> <p>ANTITRUST POLICY. J. Stine announced that the meeting of the Tech Comm would be conducted according to the Antitrust Policy of The Linux Foundation, found here: https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy/</p> <p>REVIEW OF LOGISTICS / ACTIONS FROM PRIOR MEETING. D. Cundiff reviewed the following: Technical Committee setup in Slack. Reach out if questions with getting access. Ensure you have access to OVN Github organization as most of our technical committee artifacts will be housed there. If new to Git, go to github.com to sign up for a user name and relay that information to Dan/Jon. Pull Request (PR) – if you want to make a change, have it reviewed and merged in.</p> <p>REVIEW OF LINUX FOUNDATION PROJECT CHARTER. On behalf of the LF’s Scott Nicholas, J. Stine reported; This is the official statement of what an official TLF project is. Scott has authored this –will review in following meeting as Scott unable to attend today.</p> <p>MASTER PLAN – VOCABULARY REVIEW. M. Brinas-Dobrowski led a continued v1 review of vocabulary as generated from prior conversations, and as captured in the Master Plan 1.0. Reviewed list of vocabulary compiled to date. Action: All - Please review and share any comments /edits or do a PR against the vocab doc.</p> <p>General Vocab – key updates since last meeting: Conversational AI –Let’s align on this definition; Query; Automatic Speech Recognition; Component Vocab – key updates since last meeting; Natural Language Processing; Intent; Entity; Voice Registry System; Dialog Broker; Dialog Manager;</p> <p>Discussion: Interaction Model Concept – part of NLP but need to validate; Dialog Element –need to validate if needs to be added; 3 forms of interoperability – need further discussion before adding (J. Larson); Domain skills – need to define and add. Landed on Voice Application (S. Prayaga); Dialog Broker – clarification on definition (N. Myers); Dialog Manager – clarification on definition (N. Myers). Media Player – specific functions on a platform level that cannot be done on a local level (voice application). Aligned that this is part of dialog broker (M. Lens-FitzGerald).</p> <p>MASTER PLAN 1.0. D. Cundiff, M. Brinas-Dobrowski led an introduction, initial review of the Tech Comm Master Plan. Shared document is a starting point for continued development, evolution. Will follow Symantec versioning scheme. Goal is to break down the components in the doc to kick off work streams to accomplish.</p> <p>Doc Overview:</p> <p>Solution/Principles: We will need to validate our standards by creating reference implementations; Can be implemented as open source or closed source products; Abstracted to the right level as to not too deeply specify particular technologies used to implement them; Has the ability to protect the privacy of the user AND the user can know where their privacy is protected or not – is discoverable; Standards can be implemented down to the individual –as low as localhost, a private network or as big as globally provided.</p> <p>Discussion: M. Lens-Fitzgerald: appreciates the reference to the web and basing the work that we do on that; A lot has changed since the web beginning like privacy or inclusion. If we look at the past, what can we learn from and add to our solution. Center for Humane Technology.</p> <p>John Iwasz - Heidi Culbertson is an excellent resource for input for voice application design for accessibility. Many comments in chat in support of accessibility focus. Conclusiveness &amp; abuse should be factored in.</p> <p>S. Prayaga: Interoperability /multiple assistants –how are we dealing with privacy and data management?</p> <p>M. Frazzini: Great first draft. As we discuss the important topic of privacy, we also need to talk about security. Aligned that we need to add security as a principle.</p> <p>J. Iwasz: We should leverage existing /review existing standards such as NIST and determine what could apply to voice.</p> <p>P. Bentsen: Propose adding voice quality – may be necessary to review what quality measures or what quality of service needs to be in place in order for standards to be utilized (related to diagnostics on voice input).</p> <p>Design: Component architecture overview; Component Flow ; Channel TTS/STT; NLP. NLP will determine your location and your who is being referred to.</p> <p>Voice Registry Service: Making list of invocation names public; Location sensitive; Is a global service</p> <p>J. Larson: we should capture the requirements for the VRS. Included in the master doc? No, this will be done via technical sub-committees as we break out the work and the VRS sub-committee will tackle. Suggest adding to the master plan document how we will do the work –sub committees –in Abstract and we can build out further .</p> <p>J. Herndon: As we break out the sub-committees-there will need to be interaction between /across sub-committees.</p> <p>NEXT STEPS AND ACTIONS. Prior to next meeting – Committee members: Please review the vocabulary list and share any comments /edits or do a PR against the vocab doc. Please read Master Plan document - and open issues or do pull requests in Github. Comment in slack if unable to use Github. Come to the next meeting with an idea of which projects that should be priority projects for OVN to focus upon. Think about what role you would like to perform within the Technical Committee as there are many opportunities. Prepare for roundtable discussion as to your three highest priority projects).</p> <p>MEETING ADJOURNED AT 17:00 CET, 10:00 Central Daylight US.</p> <p>17 April 2020</p> <h1 id="2020-04-03-notes-of-the-technical-committee-meeting"> <a href="#2020-04-03-notes-of-the-technical-committee-meeting" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="2020-04-03-notes-of-the-technical-committee-meeting"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 2020-04-03 Notes of the Technical Committee Meeting </h1> <p>In attendance:</p> <p>Dan Cundiff, Target (Chair); Christian Wuttke, Schwarz Gruppe; Mirko Saul, Schwarz Gruppe; Scott Nicholas, Linux Foundation; Jim Larson, SpeechTEK; Nick Myers, RedFox-ai; John Iwasz, Whetstone Technologies; Richard Vanderhorst, Wegmans; Alex Weidauer, Rasa; Lawrence Lin, China Netcasting Services Association; Maria Brina-Dobrowski, Target; Joel Crabb, Target; Kristi Dank, Target; Jon Stine, Open Voice Network.</p> <p>Meeting opened at 08:32 Central US.</p> <p>WELCOME. D. Cundiff opened meeting.</p> <p>REVIEW OF THE AGENDA.</p> <p>STATEMENT OF ANTITRUST COMPLIANCE. S. Nicholas affirmed that the meeting would operate under the Antitrust Guidelines of The Linux Foundation, as found here: https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy/</p> <p>LAUNCHING THE TECHNICAL COMMITTEE WORK. D. Cundiff emphasized the importance of asynchronous team productivity outside of regularly scheduled meetings. To do so, will use three primary tools: Slack GSuite Share Drive – used for documents that do not require team critique, editing, version control; a Share Drive file has been set up for the OVN Tech Comm team Github – Technical committee will use Github to track the work that we need to do as well as artifacts that need version control and markups/comments. Tech Comm will follow a pull request (PR) approach for this.</p> <p>OVN TECH COMM MASTER PLAN 0.1. D. Cundiff, M. Brinas-Dobrowski reviewed 0.1 draft. Document context: leveraged the research that has been done to date and is a summary of that information; seeks to be an artifact that lays out the technical opportunities for standardization. Does try to define or outline the standards at a high level. Document components include abstract, principles, design, vocabulary , component architecture proposal, component flow,<br /> component details. Process for review: Will be converted to markdown and placed in Github. Link sent out via Slack in ~1 week. Reviewers execute PR to add comments. Next discussion on 4/17, with these objectives: * review in more detail * ratify the components * get to a baselined Masterplan v1.0.0.</p> <p>VOCABULARY DESERVING OF MECE DEFINITION. D. Cundiff led roundtable discussion; noted that, in first meeting, the Tech Comm aligned that defining our vocabulary made good sense to do at the start. Since, Tech Comm members contributed vocabulary content to feed this discussion. <br /> D. Cundiff and M. Brinas-Dobrowski reviewed the vocabulary used in the 0.1 Masterplan document.</p> <p>Included: Utterance - spoken or typed phrases; Wake Word - a specific word that will catch the attention of the channel; Query - the words that the user is requesting to happen; Text-to-Speech (TTS) - TTS is a text converting to audio. It includes customized models to overcome common speech recognition barriers, such as unique vocabularies, speaking styles, or background noise; Speech-to-Text (STT) - STT is converting the response from an audio to a text; Channels – An interface and origin of communication. It is where the utterances originate; Natural Language Processing (NLP) - A service and a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers communicate with humans in their language and scales other language-related tasks. NLP helps to structure highly complicated, unstructured human utterance and vice-versa; Intent - is a part of the structured machine translation. It is the identified action that the machine interprets based on the user’s query; Entity - is a part of the structured machine translation. It is a custom level data type and considered a concrete value to associate a word in a query; Voice Registry System (VRS) - It is a global entity type in OVN and considered one of the most important offerings. It is a hierarchical registry system built on an open system similar to the Domain Name System (DNS). VRS transforms and associates the VRS names to dialog management endpoints, NLP providers, and the functionalities you get from the dialog broker. The VRS URL serves consistently regardless of the NLP. Dialog Broker (DB) - It is responsible for providing the fulfillable intents available for a resolved VRS record (e.g. where resolved VRS record “Target”, it’s fulfillable intents might be “order product, check order status, add to shopping list”. These fulfillable intents can execute remotely on the DM or download locally on the device. Dialog Manager (DM) - It handles the dynamic response of the conversation. It provides a more personalized response based on the action provided by the NLP to send back to the user Roundtable comments, contributions:</p> <p>M. Saul: Voice Name Systems – maps to VRS. Open, Interoperability, Data Privacy.</p> <p>J. Larson: Assistant (agent) – maps to channel; Intent – see above. Agent Interoperability – an agent can be replaced by another agent –rename to channel interoperability; Platform Interoperability- agent can run different platforms; Component Interoperability – component can be replaced by another component; Wake-up word – maps to wake word; Wake-up word Registry – maps to voice registry system.</p> <p>J. . Iwasz: Natural Language –maps to utterance; Voice Application – maps to dialog manager; Smart Speaker – maps to channel; Localization – internationalization, changing speech understanding and response to match local user. The Synthesized voice –the voice that is typically used on voice channels in a text-to-speech scenario; Speech-to-Text-see above; Text-to-Speech –see above.</p> <p>N. Myers: Utterance - see above; Interaction Model – will need to define for us leveraging what google, etc. have. Between the user and the channel; Artificial Intelligence – will need to define; Interactive Voice Response – will need to define but lower priority; IVR may be siloed to a channel/channel specific and OVN may cross channels; Meant for definition only, not for creating standards to IVRs; Conversational AI; Natural Language Understanding vs. Natural Language Processing – see above; Voice User Interface – maps to channel.</p> <p>A. Weidauer: Natural Language Processing –see above; Dialog Elements – the equivalent to HTML, header or footer or form/paragraph that make up the website. For voice, we will need to define what we mean by Dialog Elements as most discussions are not 1 question and 1 answer. For a non-linear conversation. Text-to-Speech – see above. Speech-to-Text – see above. Conversational Interface – maps to channel.</p> <p>QUESTIONS AND OPEN ISSUES.</p> <p>NEXT STEPS. Publish meeting notes and first draft of the vocabulary. Will be posted on GitHub so we can do PRs against to contribute. If questions on Github and PRs, reach out to Dan. Members asked to review vocabulary and contribute via comments, issues, etc. In Github. Masterplan will be published and ask members to review ahead of 4/17 meeting.</p> <p>Submitted 3 April 2020</p> <hr> <footer> <p class="text-small text-grey-dk-100 mb-0">Copyright &copy; Open Voice Network 2017-2022</p> </footer> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
