# Architecture Plan: Defining Voice Assistant Components

## Abstract

The Open Voice Network is a non-profit industry association, operating as a Directed Fund of The Linux Foundation, and dedicated to the development of technical standards and ethical use guidelines. This is an essential step for a technology and an industry that is in its earliest days, and for which user and developer value falls far short of envisioned potential. 

The Open Voice Network (OVN) Architecture Plan is a directional document with high-level design details that lays out the set of open standards in effort to define discrete components and interfaces that comprise a voice assistent, channels of communication, and discovery of voice applications. We believe that by defining the building blocks of this overaching voice application architecture, we can define interfaces that allow those building blocks to be reusable thereby fostering a voice application development community that can create, publish, and utilize components. Our goal is to foster a voice application and voice channel eco-system rich with reusable components.

The content of this document defines the scope of what the OVN aims to work on and the sections below can map to working groups who will be defining components and component interfaces.

## Prerequisite References

This document builds on the [Technical Master Plan](https://github.com/open-voice-network/docs/blob/master/technical_masterplan.md). The terminology used in this document assumes the reader has familiarity with the aforementioned document. 

The component-driven model of the architecture plan seeks to further break down the component architecture defined in the Technical Master Plan.

Component interfaces are further based on this component flow model.
