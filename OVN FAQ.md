Open Voice Network Launch Q2 2021
2021.04.25

**What is the OVN and what challenge is it answering?**

●	The Open Voice Network (OVN) is an open source enterprise industry association, formed to create standards and usage guidelines for artificial intelligence-enabled voice assistance.  These are expected to address issues of system interoperability, destination accessibility, user identification, data privacy and data security. 

●	Voice assistance is in its early days, akin to the early, pre-standards days of the internet. Voice assistance is now emerging as a primary consumer interface to the digital world, including smart devices and connected environments.  In addition, the ecosystem of voice assistance is now in the midst of a major transition, as  brand- and organization-managed voice assistants  now provide services that are independent of the platforms of big tech providers.  The development and adoption of open standards for voice will – as with the internet – accelerate innovation, development, and enterprise adoption. 

**Q. Who will benefit?**

●	Any consumer wishing to connect to the digital world or to a smart environment with the ease and convenience of voice assistance. 
●	Every organization that wishes to provide ease and convenience to its customers and constituents.  Especially commerce (retail and consumer goods manufacturing and marketing), media and entertainment, healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, and financial services.  

**Q. Why was it formed?** 

●	To address issues of trustworthiness – issues of  data privacy, destination accessibility, ease of use, and business value -- that currently discourage usage and adoption of voice assistance for users and enterprises alike.  
●	To unleash – through the development of industry standards -- the potential and value of voice assistance for consumers and consumer-facing industries.  The 1983 publication of the Domain Name Service (DNS) that created standardized  destination addresses for the internet is but one example of where substantial user value was created through standards. 
●	To address a number of important issues now emerging in the new ecosystem of voice assistance, such as interoperability, destination accessibility, user identification, consumer and commercial data privacy, and voice-specific data security.   

**Q. Why now?**

●	Voice assistance is at a critical inflection point – much as the internet was back in its early days of the proprietary browser wars.  Consumers have shown considerable interest in the ease and convenience of audio and voice, as shown in the growth of podcasts and the adoption of smart speakers.  Yet users – both individuals and organizations that seek to communicate with constituents – have largely been locked into proprietary ecosystems that limit choice and reach.  Standards for interoperability, destination accessibility (a DNS for voice), user identification, data privacy and data security will help unlock the development of an open, interoperable ecosystem for voice and the innovation that is critical to adoption and value creation.
●	Consumer-centric privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) require careful and secure use of consumer data.  The use and ecosystem of voice assistance has largely developed since the GDPR and CCPA were first written.  Given that voice is rich with personal data – sentiment, biometric identification, and biomarkers are but some of the indicators --  standards and guidelines that are specific to voice will help organizations use this technology with confidence. 

**Q.  Is voice assistance just about smart speakers?**

•	No.  Voice assistance is artificial intelligence-dependent software which can reside on nearly any digital hardware.   In the United States in 2020, according to voicebot.ai¹, an analyst firm, smart speakers were the fourth-most prevalent endpoint for voice assistance.  The top three, in order, were smartphones, smart homes, and wearables.   Going forward, voice assistance is expected to be an available interface for every digital device and environment. 

**Q. What does the Open Voice Network intend to accomplish?**

●	Standards development: research, development, and the proposal of global standards that will unlock the value of voice and accelerate “open” voice.  These could include standards for interoperability, destination accessibility (a DNS for voice), user identification and authentication, and voice-specific data privacy and security.
●	Industry usage guidelines and value propositions:  research, development, and the proposal of organizational usage guidance, especially in the realms of voice-specific privacy, data use, and data security, and the documentation and communication of organizational voice-centric best practices. 
●	Advocacy: working with and through existing industry associations on relevant voice-specific regulatory and legislative issues.

**Q. Who is involved?** 

●	The founding enterprise sponsors of the Open Voice Network are Target Corporation, Schwarz Gruppe, Microsoft, Wegmans Food Markets, and Deutsche Telekom.  
●	In addition to representatives of the founding enterprise sponsors, more than 100 volunteers from 12 nations regularly participate in the research and development work of the Open Voice Network. 

**Q. How will the Linux Foundation move the project forward?**

●	The Linux Foundation open governance model will allow for community-wide contributions that will accelerate AI-voice standards rollout and adoption.

**Q. How is the Open Voice Network funded and governed?** 

●	As an open source community of the Linux Foundation, the Open Voice Network is independently funded through sponsor financial contributions.   It is governed by a Steering Committee of sponsor firm representatives, and according to Linux Foundation policies and best practices. 

**Q. What is the organizational structure of the Open Voice Network?** 

•	Four standing committees – Budget, Legal, Outreach, and Technical – report to the Steering Committee.   The standards development work of the Open Voice Network is largely the responsibility of the Technical Committee. 
•	The four standing committees are advised by industry- or topic-specific communities of voice practitioners, responsible for the development and identification of value propositions and usage guidelines.
